				DECtalk software and the Microsoft Speech API


   The DECtalk software for the Windows 95 and the Windows NT operating 
   systems now supports most of the Microsoft Speech API. This allows the 
   DECtalk software to work as an OLE server in any OLE application 
   environment.

   Please see readme.txt for information on specific functions supported.
