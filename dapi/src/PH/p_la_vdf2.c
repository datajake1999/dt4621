 * Rev  Who     Date            Description
 * ---  -----   -----------     --------------------------------------------
 * 0001 DK	 	12/06/1984      Adopted from DECtalk klvdef.c
 * 0002 DGC		12/27/1984      Added the "readonly" things for the 80186.
 * 0003 DK		01/14/1985	    Fine tune voices to new tilt(f0) function
 * 0004 DK		01/21/1985      Increase richness of Paul (less base, more like old Paul)
 * 0005 DK		04/22/1985      Fix Betty to better match Diane Br.
 * 0006 DK		04/30/1985    	Overload calibration for 3.0 for all voices
 * 0007 DK		06/03/1985      Increase SR for more lively voices
 * 0008 DK		06/10/1985      Paul: ap down, Betty: ap up, Dennis: less breathy
 * 0009 DK		06/20/1985      Betty: ap back down a bit
 * 0010 DK		07/24/1985	    Boost LO so don't have to shift R1c output
 * 0011 DK		07/29/1985      Adjust spdef levels to avoid overloads during aspiration
 * 0012 DK		04/29/1985     	Ursula still overloads, back off gains
 * 0013 DGC		09/06/1985		Harry head size to 115, from 120.
 * 0014 DK		05/21/1986      All voices spectral tilt upward due to spc change
 *                       		and Betty more breathy
 * 0015 DK		09/19/1986      Reduce hat & stress gestures for Paul ala Bell rules
 *                       		Richness, smoothness and NF no longer have any meaning
 * 0016 DK		03/13/1987      Make Betty vowels conform to analysis of bVbVbVb
 * 0017 DK		03/25/1988     	Replace FT by FL (f0flutter in % of max)
 * 0018	MGS		06/04/1996 		Added 8 kHz speaker definitions
 * 0019 EDB		11/13/1996		increase voice volume.
 * 0020 EDB 	12/10/1996		Many changes...
 * 0021 EDB		01/10/1997		data change in two places.
 * 0022 NCS     01/17/1997      Fixed broken compile time error -- commas.
 * 0023 EAB		02/14/1997		Trung and I tuned gains for demo release
 * 0024 TQL		02/20/1997		Tuned the gains for code freeze.
 * 0025 TQL		03/17/1997		Tuned the gains for code freeze.
 * 0026 TQL		05/08/1997		Tuned the gains for code freeze.
 * 0027 MGS     02/17/1998      Tuned to fix Ursula overload.
 * 0028 JAW     04/27/1998      Added default glottal speeds.
 * 0029 EAB		07/08/1998		Temporarily increse sm as a result of tilt problems and changes
								long term fix is first a better tilt filter-working the issue with TOM
								ALso FL is really FT and had to be adjusted....
 * 0030 EAB 	07/20/1998     	Copied from p_sp_vdf1.c after merge with _LA
 * 0031 EAB		09/24/1998     	Prelim tuned for ginger
 * 0032 EAB		09/30/1998     	EAB changed
 * 0033 EAB 	10/16/1998 		EAB TUned voices dor new release except NOT 8KHZ yet!!!
 * 0034 EAB 	10/26/1998 		Careful release tuning of 10khz voices 
 * 0035 EAB 	10/29/1998 		Adjusted for fact that lowcompute was on
 * 0036	EAB 	10/29/1998 		New refinements
 * 0027 EAB 	11/05/1998 		EAB Refined tunings for 8 and 11 after Jenny's tuning BATS 807
 * 0028 CAB		10/18/2000		Changed copyright info and formatted comment section
 * 0029 EAB		4/4/2001			Reduced smothinees setting ala Bat 961 too "muffled"
