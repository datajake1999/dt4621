 *    DECtalk-pc character folding and conversion tables ...  the following
 *    sets of tables are used to accept, type, and translate input characters.  
 *    This looks like a big waste of space until you realize the baggage you
 *    would have to carry around with each character otherwise ...
 *
 *	  This file for now is used by all the languages.  Except for ls_fold.tab.
 *
 *
 *  Basically ...
 *
 *    lower case conversion is now  ls_lower[c]
 *    upper case conversion is now  ls_upper[c]
 *
