 *    Revision History:
 *
 * Rev  Who     Date            Description
 * ---  -----   -----------     -------------------------------------------- 
 * 01   DGC		01/19/1985		Removed "undef vax" for DHK.
 * 02   DGC		01/31/1985		Added "PTSYNC".
 * 03   DGC		02/12/1985		Modified error syndromes. Deleted "NTASK".
 *                      		Added diagnostic states.
 * 04   DGC		02/13/1985		Added definition for ABO "test ok" flag.
 *                      		Changed the power-up mode definitions to
 *                      		ignore W11. Put firmware version code into
 *                      		this file, so "dialup" can get it.
 * 05   DK		02/22/1985		[M] is no more. It's slot is now used by
 *                      		D_DENTALIZED.
 * 06   DGC		03/05/1985		Ripped out all of the clock queue stuff.
 *                      		Moved the definition of the NUDPHON from
 *                      		"lsdef.h" to here, where it belongs.
 * 07   DGC		03/06/1985      Changed the test and sync codes fed to
 *                      		the SPC again.
 * 08   DGC		03/11/1985		Changes to the I/O map to deal with
 *                      		the bugs in the DTMF chip. The "option
 *                      		present" moved to SWJMPR. The "tone valid"
 *                      		is brought in where "option present" was
 *                      		in GPIO (read).
 * 09   DGC		03/19/1985		Added some definitions to deal with the
 *                      		call progress detection system.
 * 10   DGC		04/04/1985		Added support for 150 baud and the SNUSECR
 *                      		option switch.
 * 11   DGC		04/10/1985		Added the definitions for the option module.
 * 12   DGC		04/17/1985		Added default versus 0 stuff to "SEQ".
 *                      		Added the "PPARSE" structure.
 * 13   DGC		04/29/1985		Added a subfunction code for testing the
 *                      		TLI cadence detector.
 * 14   DGC		04/30/1985		Rearranged the switches so that the
 *                      		"factory default" is all switches open.
 * 15   DGC		05/10/1985		W11 => NNOTIME
 * 16   DGC		06/07/1985	    "ef" => "lx" in speaker definition.
 * 17   DGC		06/18/1985   	"g5" => "lo" in speaker definition.
 * 18   DGC		06/19/1985      Added a new telephone subfunction code to
 *                      		request reduced level DTMF bursts during the
 *                      		self tests.
 * 19   DGC		08/08/1985    	Put the NTASK back. Needed by the new code
 *                      		for sync.
 * ------------------   Released as C5005 V1.0 firmware.
 * 20   DGC		10/21/1986	    Changes for KRM.
 * 21   DGC		04/06/1987	    Bumped firmware revision to 1.1
 * 22   DGC		05/06/1987	    Added KRMMOD conditional for real KRM module.
 * 23   eab		11/22/1989	    updated for new krm build added bch define
 *                      		added nkr define
 * 24   eab		01/16/1990	    Remove bch def. all version now support
 *								sprate to 550.
 * 25	cjl		12/15/1994	 	Added pre-processor code to prevent duplicates.
 * 26	gl		04/04/1996	 	Added debug flag to support the debug command.
