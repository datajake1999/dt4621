**  FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION: DTKmmioAdvance
**	This function advances the I/O buffer of a file set up for
**	direct I/O buffer access with mmioGetInfo. If the file is opened for
**	reading, the I/O buffer is filled from the disk. If the file
**	is opened for writing and the MMIO_DIRTY flag is set in the dwFlags
**	field of the MMIOINFO structure, the buffer is written to disk. The
**	pchNext, pchEndRead, and pchEndWrite fields of the MMIOINFO structure
**	are updated to reflect the new state of the I/O buffer.
**
**  DEVIATIONS FROM SPEC
**	Not supported
**
**  FORMAL PARAMETERS:
**	hmmio	   Specifies the file handle for a file opened with mmioOpen
**	lpmmioinfo Specifies a far pointer to the MMIOINFo structure
**		   obtained with mmioGetInfo.
**	wFlags	   Specifies options for the operation. Contains exaactly
**		   one of the following two flags:
**		MMIO_READ 	The buffer is filled from the file
**		MMIO_WRITE	The buffer is written to the file
**
**  RETURN VALUE:
**	For now, onlyMMIOERR_UNBUFFERED
**
**	The return value is zero if the operation is successful.
**	Otherwise, the return value specifies an error code. The error code
**	can be one of the following codes:
**		MMIOERR_CANNOTWRITE 
**		    The contents of the buffer could not be written to the disk
**		MMIOERR_CANNOTREAD 
**		    An error occurred while re-filling the buffer
**		MMIOERR_UNBUFFERED
**		    The specified file is not opened for buffered I/O
**		MMIOERR_CANNOTEXPAND 
**		    The specified memory file cannot be expanded, probably 
**		    because the adwInfo[0] field was set to zero in the initial
**		    call to mmioOpen
**		MMIOERR_OUTOFMEMORY 
**		    There was not enough memory to expand a memory
**		    file for further writing
**
**  DESIGN:
**	If the specified file is opened for writing or for both
**	reading and writing, the I/O buffer will be flushed to disk before the
**	next buffer is read. If the I/O buffer cannot be written to disk
**	because the disk is full, then mmioAdvance will return
**	MMIOERR_CANNOTWRITE.
**	
**	If the specified file is only open for writing, the MMIO_WRITE flag
**	must be specified.
**	
**	If you have written to the I/O buffer, you must set the MMIO_DIRTY
**	flag in the dwFlags field of the MMIOINFO structure before calling
**	mmioAdvance. Otherwise, the buffer will not be written to disk.
**	
**	If the end of file is reached, mmioAdvance will still return success,
**	even though no more data can be read. Thus, to check for the end of
**	the file, it is necessary to see if the pchNext and pchEndRead fields
**	of the MMIOINFO structure are equal after calling mmioAdvance.

**  FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION: DTKmmioOpen
**	This function opens a file for unbuffered or buffered I/O. The
**	file can be a DOS file, a memory file, or an element of a custom
**	storage system.
**	
**  DEVIATIONS FROM SPEC
**	buffered I/O is not supported
**	installable I/O procs are not handled
**	dos file naming conventions are not supported
**	file access flags are not supported
**	memory files are not supported
**	adwInfo[0] can contain a file handle with
**		restrictions that the file be seekable with lseek
**	path name length restrictions differ from DOS (see below)
**	the use of the following flags will generate an error:
**	    MMIO_ALLOCBUF
**	    MMIO_COMPAT
**	    MMIO_EXCLUSIVE
**	    MMIO_DENYWRITE
**	    MMIO_DENYREAD
**	    MMIO_DENYNONE
**	Warning: for UNIX hacks, these parameters have different
**	    semantics than UNIX's open or fopen
**	The mmioOpen spec has a comment that open files are
**	not automagically closed when the application exists.
**	That is not true here for this release.
**
**  FORMAL PARAMETERS:
**	szFileName  Specifies a far pointer to a string containing
**		    the filename of the file to open. If no I/O procedure is
**		    specified to open the file, then the filename determines how
**		    the file is opened, as follows:
**
**		    + If the filename does no contain "+", then it is assumed to
**		      be the name of a DOS file (not supported)
**
**		    + If the filename is of the form "foo.ext+bar", then the
**		      extension "EXT" is assumed to identify an instaed I/O
**		      procedure which is called to perform I/O on the file (see
**		      mmioInstallIOProc) (not supported)
**
**		    + If the filename is NULL and no I/O procedure is given,
**		      then adwInfo[0] is assumed to be the DOS file handle of a
**		      currently open file. (adwInfo[0] represents the handle of 
**		      a UNIX file descriptor of the type returned by open(2) 
**		      or an equivalent function. The file must be seek'able 
**		      with lseek (e.g., not a pipe). In addition, file 
**		      descriptor 0 is not a valid descriptor to place here, 
**		      otherwise we can't tell if someone screwed up or are 
**		      initializing lpmmioinfo with all zeros.)
**
**		    The filename should not be longer than 128 bytes, including
**		    the terminating NULL. (This should read, the length of the
**		    path string cannot exceed PATH_MAX nor can a component
**		    exceed NAME_MAX).
**
**		    When opening a memory file, set
**		    szFilename to NULL (not supported)
**	lpmmioinfo  Specifies a far pointer to an MMIOINFO
**		    structure containing extra parameters used by mmioOpen.
**		    Unless you are opening a memory file, specifying the
**		    size of a buffer for buffered I/O, or specifying an
**		    uninstalled I/O procedure to open a file, this paramter
**		    should be NULL.
**
**		    If lpmmioinfo is not NULL, all
**		    unused fields of the MMIOINFO structure it references
**		    must be set to zero, including the reserved fields.
**
**		    (The spec is inconsitent. adwInfo[0] can be set to an
**		    already open file handle without any of the above being
**		    true.
**		    All but the adwInfo field is supported. If anything is
**		    not null, a MMIOERR_CANNOTOPEN error will be returned)
**	dwOpenFlags Specifies option flags for the open
**		    operation. The MMIO_READ, MMIO_WRITE, and
**		    MMIO_READWRITE flags are mutually exclusive -- only one
**		    should be specified. The MMIO_COMPAT, MMIO_EXLUSIVE,
**		    MMIO_DENTWRITE, MMIO_DENYREAD, and MMIO_DENYNONE flags
**		    are DOS file-sharing flags, and can only be used after
**		    the DOS command SHARE has been executed (not
**		    supported).
**		    
**		    MMIO_READ 	Opens the file for reading only. This
**			is the default, if MMIO_WRITE and MMIO_READWRITE are
**			not specified.
**		    
**		    MMIO_WRITE	Opens the file for writing. You should
**			not read from a file opened in this mode.
**
**		    MMIO_READWRITE	Opens the file for both reading and
**			writing.
**
**		    MMIO_CREATE	Creates a new file. If the file already
**			exists, it is truncated to zero length. For memory
**			files, MMIO_CREATE indicates the end of the file is
**			initially at the start of the buffer.
**
**		    MMIO_DELETE	Deletes a file. If this flag is
**			specified, szFilename shoudl not be NULL. The return
**			value will be TRUE (cast to HMMIO) if the file was
**			deleted successfully, FALSE otherwise. Do not call
**			mmioClose for a file that has been deleted. If this
**			flag is specified, all other flags are ignored.
**
**		    MMIO_ALLOCBUF	Opens a file for buffered I/O. To
**			allocate a buffer larger or smaller than the default
**			buffer size (8K), set the cchBuffer field of the
**			MMIOINFO structure to the desired buffer size. If
**			cchBuffer is zero, then the default buffer size is
**			used. If you are providing your own I/O buffer, then
**			the MMIO_ALLOCBUF flag should not be used. (not
**			supported).
**
**		    MMIO_COMPAT	Opens the file with compatibility mode,
**			allowing any process on a given machine to open the
**			file any number of times. mmioOpen fails if the file
**			has been opened with any of the other sharing modes.
**			(not supoprted).
**
**		    MMIO_EXCLUSIVE	Opens the file with exclusive mode,
**			denying other processes both read and write access to
**			the file. mmioOpen fails if the file has been opened in
**			any other mode for read or write access, even by the
**			current process.  (not supoprted).
**
**		    MMIO_DENYWRITE	Opens the file and denies other
**			processes write access to the file. mmioOpen fails if
**			the file has been opened in compatibility or for write
**			access by any other process. (not supported)
**
**		    MMIO_DENYREAD	Opens the file and denies other
**			processes read access to the file. mmopOpen fails if
**			the file has been opened in compatibility mode or for
**			read access by any other process. (not supported)
**
**		    MMIO_DENYNONE	Opens the file without denying other
**			processes read or write access to the file. mmioOpen
**			fails if the file has been opened in compatibility mode
**			by any other process. (not supported)
**
**  RETURN VALUE:
**	The return value is a handle to the opend file.
**	This handle is not a DOS file handle (nor is it a UNIX
**	file handle) -- do not use if with any file I/O
**	functions other than MMIO functions.
**
**	If the file cannot be opened, the return value is NULL.
**	If lpmmioinfo is not NULL, then its wError field will
**	contain extended error information returned by the I/O
**	procedure.
**
**  SIDE EFFECTS:
**	when lpmmioinfo is used, wError field will be set with
**		any error conditions
**
**  DESIGN:
**	none needed at this point
**	eventually, all file based I/O should come through this
** 	interface or a more generic interface to handle files
**	on remote systems, pipes, etc.
**	eventually, we will also want to check the current list
** 	of open files to reuse information if possible

**	Also, the caller supplied lpck will not be modified if

**
**  FORMAL PARAMETERS:
**	hmmio 	Specifies the file handle of an open RIFF file.
**
**	lpck 	Specifies a far pointer to a
**	caller-supplied  MMCKINFO structure that DTKmmioDescend fills
**	with the following information:
**
**	-- The MMCKINFO.ckid field is the chunk ID of the chunk.
**
**	-- The MMCKINFO.cksize field is the size of the data portion
**	of the chunk. The data size includes the form type or list type (if
**	any), but does not include the 8-byte chunk header or the pad byte at
**	the end of the data (if any).
**
**	-- The MMCKINFO.fccType field is the form type if 
**	MMCKINFO.ckid is "RIFF", or the list type if 
**	MMCKINFO.ckid is "LIST". Otherwise, it is NULL.
**
**	-- The MMCKINFO.dwDataOffset field is the file offset of the
**	beginning of the data portion of the chunk.	If the chunk is a
**	"RIFF" chunk or a "LIST" chunk, then MMCKINFO.dwDataOffset
**	is the offset of the form type or list type.
**
**	-- The MMCKINFO.dwFlags contains other information about the chunk.
**	Currently, this information is not used and is set to zero.
**
**	If the MMIO_FINDCHUNK, MMIO_FINDRIFF, or MMIO_FINDLIST flag is
**	specified for wFlags, then the MMCKINFO structure is also
**	used to pass parameters to DTKmmioDescend:
**
**	-- The MMCKINFO.ckid field specifies the four-character code
**	of the chunk ID, form type, or list type to search for.
**
**	lpckParent 	Specifies a far pointer to an
**	optional caller-supplied MMCKINFO structure identifying
**	the parent of the chunk being searched for.
**	A parent of a chunk is the enclosing chunk--only "RIFF" and "LIST"
**	chunks can be parents.  If lpckParent is not NULL, then 
**	DTKmmioDescend assumes the MMCKINFO structure it refers to
**	was filled when DTKmmioDescend was called to descend into the parent
**	chunk, and DTKmmioDescend will only search for a chunk within the
**	parent chunk. Set lpckParent to NULL if no parent chunk is
**	being specified.
**
**	wFlags 	Specifies search options. Contains up to one
**	of the following flags. If no flags are specified, 
**	DTKmmioDescend descends into the chunk beginning at the current file
**	position. 
**
**		MMIO_FINDCHUNK | Searches for a chunk with the specified chunk ID.
**
**		MMIO_FINDRIFF | Searches for a chunk with chunk ID "RIFF"
**		and with the specified form type.
**
**		MMIO_FINDLIST | Searches for a chunk with chunk ID "LIST"
**		and with the specified form type.
**
**  RETURN VALUE:
**	The return value is zero if the function is successful.
**	Otherwise, the return value specifies an error code. If the end of
**	the file (or the end of the parent chunk, if given) is reached before
**	the desired chunk is found, the return value is
**	MMIOERR_CHUNKNOTFOUND. 
**
**  DESIGN:
**	A RIFF chunk consists of a four-byte chunk ID (type FOURCC),
**	followed by a four-byte chunk size (type DWORD), followed
**	by the data portion of the chunk, followed by a null pad byte if
**	the size of the data portion is odd. If the chunk ID is "RIFF" or
**	"LIST", the first four bytes of the data portion of the chunk are
**	a form type or list type (type FOURCC).
**
**	If DTKmmioDescend is used to search for a chunk, the file 
**	position should be at the beginning of a
**	chunk before calling DTKmmioDescend. The search begins at the
**	current file position and continues to the end of the file. If a
**	parent chunk is specified, the file position should be somewhere
**	within the parent chunk before calling DTKmmioDescend. In this case,
**	the search begins at the current file position and continues to the
**	end of the parent chunk.
**
**	If DTKmmioDescend is unsuccessful in searching for a chunk, the
**	current file position is undefined. If DTKmmioDescend is
**	successful, the current file position is changed. If the chunk 
**	is a "RIFF" or "LIST" chunk, the new file position
**	will be just after the form type or list type (12 bytes from the
**	beginning of the chunk). For other chunks, the new file position will be
**	the start of the data portion of the chunk (8 bytes from the
**	beginning of the chunk).
**		
**	For efficient RIFF file I/O, use buffered I/O.
