Introduction: 
=============
  This file outlines the procedures involved in making install diskettes
  for the DECtalk software v4.30 for both Windows'NT and Windows'95 
  operating systems.The Install script is written using InstallShield3.

Procedure:
==========
  The different steps involved in making install diskettes are outlined
  in the following sub sections.

  1. Create a Main Directory,with associated tools. 
  
  2. Preparing the DECtalk software. 
  
  3. Prepare InstallShield specific files.
  
  4. Compile Install Shield scrpit.

  5. Compress the DECtalk software files.

  6. Split the DECtalk software compressed file.
  
  7. Prepare the package list.
  
  8. Specify Directories to copy final Install Components.

  All the above steps should be performed for each release of the
  DECtalk software.
  
  It is advisable to not to change these directories,files and associate 
  this version of install diskettes with corresponding Source code for
  the DECtalk software and Freeze them after the MAJOR RELEASE.

  For the subsequent enhancements,bug fixes to the DECtalk software,
  bug fixes to the Install script,Follow the same Procedure in separate 
  new Main directory. 

1. Create a Main Directory with associated tools:
   ==============================================
   Create a directory with a name that specifies a particular version
   of DECtalk software. 
   (For example, Dir name: dtlkv430 for DECtalk v4.30 release version)

   All the batch files to automate the build procedure,and any 
   README.TXT file to describe this particular install version,should
   be kept under this directory.(Ex :dtlkv430)  
   
   Create a TOOLS directory to copy InstallShield tools.These files
   don't change for each release.
   ICOMP.EXE   : Compress/Decompress files utility.
   SPLIT.EXE   : Split utility to split large compressed files.

2. Preparing the DECtalk software :
   ================================
   The software should be built before performing this step.
   All the DLLs should be Release version.(Without Debug symbols)

   Create a "DATA" directory under the above Install directory.
   (i.e dtlkv430\data).This directory will be organized to copy
   the DECtalk software files.
   There will be different sub-directories under this directory 
   to copy the files.The install script follows this directory structure 
   while decompressing the files and copying them on to the target drive.
   (Note: Deviateing from this structure needs changes in Install script
          file setup.rul)

   Create the following sub-directories (under dtlkv430\data) and copy
   the files from the DECtalk software build,source directories as mentioned 
   below.
   

   program  :SPEAK.EXE,WINDIC.EXE,DTSAMPLE.EXE,DTLKTTSE.DLL,MAILINIT.EXE, 
             TTSTEST.EXE (A sample program from Microsoft Speech SDK to
                          demo the OLE-version of DECtalk speech engine.)
   
   help     :DTLKUSER.HLP, DTLKPROG.HLP help files.
   
   sample   :All sample programs source code goes here in their own 
             sub-directories under this directory.
             (sample\dtmemory, sample\say,sample\dtsample etc..)

   speech   :Microsoft Speech SDK specific files. SPEECH.DLL 
             (This file will be copied without overwriting the latest
              version.i.e ,If Microsoft Speech SDK is already installed
              on the Target platform,It checks the version of DLL
              before copying from the diskette.Latest version will be
              protected.The install diskette has First release version 
              of Speech SDK DLL ,SPEECH.DLL.(size:59,904 Dt:11/22/95)
   
   Sprogram :The DECtalk software files need to copy to Windows 
             Directory and its System directory.
             
             Windows Directory : SAY.EXE,TTSSRV.EXE,MTMAPI.EXE
             Windows System Dir: DECTALK.DLL,MAILTALK.DLL
   
   Any new files being developed in future should follow the same
   above guidelines.

   The Readme.TXT,WORD.TXT,DECTALK.DIC,USER.TAB files should be copied
   at the root directory of "data" (i.e dtlkv430\data\ )

   Enhancement :   
   =============
   A text file Dtalkver.txt (Manually created)file will be copied
   to the target directory.This will have version information
   specific to DECtalk Dlls and build version.(Will be provided an
   Icon for this). Each bug report should send the information in
   this file.

3.Prepare InstallShield specific files:
  =====================================
  There are two types of InstallShield specific files that should go 
  with the install diskettes.One is in compressed format,and another 
  is set of InstallShield specific executables,Dlls.

  The compressed file should be named as _setup.lib .This file consists
  InstallShield specific files and also the DECtalk software Install 
  program specific files.
  
  Compress the following files using ICOMP.EXE utility in TOOLS directory
  (See step 1).in to compressed file _setup.lib

  InstallShield specific files :  UNINST.EXE,_ISRES.DLL,CTL3D32.DLL,

  DECtalk software Install specific : DIGITAL.BMP (digital logo)
                                      license.txt (copyright   )

  First copy these files from their original location to the 
  directory "instdec" under Main directory (i.e dtalkv430\instdec)
  and then compress them to the output file "_setup.lib".

  The following files are just to be copied as it is onto 
  the directory "Idisk" under Main Directory(i.e dtalkv430\Idisk)
  and later these file will be copied to the directory "Disk1"
  under Main Dir(i.e dtalkv430\Disk1)that will have all the files 
  needed to copy on to Install diskette #1.

  (All these files are InstallShield specific)
  SETUP.EXE,_ISDEL.EXE,_INST32I.EX_,_SETUP.DLL


4. Compile Install Shield scrpit:
   ==============================
   Create a sub-directory "setup" under Main directory (Ex:dtalkv430),to
   keep install script file and its associated files.

   SETUP.RUL is the install script file for DECTALK install program.

   Copy COMPILE.EXE (InstallShield script compiler),
        PACKLIST.EXE(InstallShield Package list compiler). 
   to this directory.
   
   Compile the setup.rul with script compiler and the output file
   will be SETUP.INS file.This file later will be copied to install
   diskette.

5. Compress the DECtalk software files:
   ====================================
   Compress all the files under the "data" directory including its
   sub-directories to "DECTALK.Z" and copy it to "data" directory.
   
   The command to do this will be (when you execute from the Main-Dir)
       tools\icomp -i data\*.* data\dectalk.z

6. Split the DECtalk software compressed file:
   ===========================================
   Since the compressed file is large enough to not to fit in a single
   diskette,It has to be split to organize the files in to two diskettes 
   for the DECtalk software installation.

   The split command should be run on main compressed file dectalk.z
   to split into dectalk.1 and dectalk.2 files.

   The size of dectalk.1 should be specified in Split command,because
   the Install diskette #1 will have additional files besides this
   compressed file. (See step 8 later for list of files on each
   installation diskette.)

   The split command will be as below :
   
   The size of dectalk.1 is specified as 500 kbytes.
   
   tools\split data\dectalk.z -D1@500 -c

7. Prepare the package list:
   =========================
   Create a text file setup.lst to have the following two lines.
   1;
   ..\data\dectalk.z
   in the sub-directory "setup"that has setup.rul file.
   (i.e dtalkv430\setup)

   compile setup.lst file with PACKLIST.EXE to generate SETUP.PKG file.

8. Specify Directories to copy final Install Components.
   ====================================================
   Create two directories under Main directory for each Install
   diskettes.

   The Disk1 directory contains the files to copy to Install Diskette #1.
   List of files :
   1.All the files from "IDISK" directory (See step 3)
   2.Copy the file _setup.lib from "INSTDEC" directory(See step 3)
   3.Copy SETUP.INS file from "SETUP" directory.(See step 4)
   4.Copy SETUP.PKG file from "SETUP" directory.(See step 7)
   5.Copy DECTALK.1 file from "DATA" directory. (See step 6)

   6.Create an empty file "DISK1.ID under this directory to serve as 
   a tag file for the Install Diskette #1. (MUST...)

   Total files : 9
   
   The Disk2 directory contains the following files to copy to 
   Install Diskette #2.
   1. Copy DECTALK.2 file from "DATA" directory. (see step 6)
   2. Create an empty file "DISK2.ID under this directory to serve as 
      a tag file for the Install Diskette #1. (MUST...)

   Total files: 2
