DESCRIPTION

    DECtalk Software Version 4.2 for Digital UNIX [R] is  text to speech 
    software based on Digital Equipment Corporation's industry-leading 
    text-to-speech synthesis technology.

    DECtalk Software allows applications to convert standard ASCII text
    in American English into highly intelligible and natural sounding speech,
    playable through audio hardware on Alpha AXP workstations.

    The software is offered in two packages - a Runtime kit and a 
    Development kit. The Runtime kit consists of:

       o  An application called speak that allows an user to synthesize 
          a text file or text typed into a window. It provides control of 
          voice and speaking rate and its interface is consistent with the 
          Motif windowing environment.

       o  mailtalk - an application that announces incoming mail messages
          aclock - an application that speaks clock time at set intervals

       o  A Motif windows based user dictionary compiler called windict to
          create customized pronunciation dictionaries


    The Development kit consists of:

       o  An application programming interface to allow any application to
          include text-to-speech synthesis with functions for all the fea-
          tures listed below. 

       o  C language sample code is provided for the following applets:

          -  xmsay - a Motif applet that allows an user to synthesize a text
             file to speech

          -  say - a command line applet that allows an user to synthesize
             a text file to speech

          -  dtmemory - returns synthesized speech in in-memory buffers and
             writes it to a file

 DECtalk Software API Features support:

       o  American English text-to-speech synthesis

       o  Nine defined voice personalities (four female, four male, and one
          child)

       o  Ability to say letters, words, or phrases

       o  Pause, continue, and stop speaking control

       o  Variable speaking rates from 75 words per minute to 600 words per
          minute

       o  Accurate letter-to-sound pronunciation rules

       o  Large internal (fixed) dictionary

       o  Expanded developer-definable dictionary

       o  Punctuation control for pauses, pitch and stress

       o  Output stereo volume control

       o  Ability to say proper names

       o  User-defined pronunciation dictionary

       o  Ability to synthesize to a file

       o  Ability to synthesize to memory

       o  Ability to play wave audio files

       o  Ability to generate DTMF tones for dialing
