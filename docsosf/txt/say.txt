      say [-h] [-s #] [-r #] [-d #] [file] [-a "text"]


DESCRIPTION
      The say program is a command-line program that produces synthesized 
      audio of the input ascii text. It has the following command line 
      switches:

         -a "text"  This command line switch is followed by the quoted string.
                    The text in the quoted string is spoken, at the end of 
                    which the program returns to the OSF/1 command prompt.

         -d #       Is used to select the audio output device.
         -e #       Is used to select the the output wave file format.  Integers
                    1 to 3 are valid input to this option and they specify the
                    following:
                          1. PCM, 16 bit Mono 11 KHz format
                          2. PCM, 8 bit Mono 11 KHz format
                          3. Mu-law, 8 bit Mono 8 KHz format
         -f <filename> Output wave file name
         -h         Displays the command line parameter list
         -r #       Speaking rate (75 - 650)
         -s #       Speaker number (1-9)
