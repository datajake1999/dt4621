[Image] Preface: About this Guide

This guide contains instructions for the installation of the Runtime
segment DECtalk Software product. It also contains the information you need
to run the DECtalk Software applications that are included with this
product.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] What's the Difference Between the DECtalk Software Runtime Kit and
the DECtalk Software Development Kit?

DECtalk Software is packaged as a Runtime kit and a Development kit. The
Runtime kit gives you access to the following DECtalk Software
applications: mailtalk, say, speak, emacspeak, DECface, aclock, and
windict.

In order to develop your own DECtalk Software applications, you must order
the DECtalk Software Developer's kit. DECtalk Software Developer's kit
gives you access to the DECtalk Software API and sources for some sample
application programs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] License Requirements

You can run one copy of any DECtalk Software application at a time without
needing an LMF license. A license is required to run more than one copy.
See the section on LMF Licensing in Chapter 1 for more information.

          MB1  MB1 indicates the left mouse button
     click on  Click on means to press and release MB1.
 double click  Double click means to press and release
               MB1 twice in rapid succession without
               moving the mouse.
         drag  The phrase drag means to press and hold
               MB1, move the mouse, and then release MB1
               when the pointer is in the desired
               position.
       Ctrl/x  A sequence such as Ctrl / x indicates
               that you must press the Ctrl key while
               you press another key.
 Menu Command  The right arrow key indicates an
               abbreviated instruction for choosing a
               command from a menu. For example, File
               Exit means pull down the File menu, move
               the pointer to the Exit command, and
               release MB1.
 Courier type  Courier type indicates text that you type
               and is displayed on the screen. This is
               most often used for program code examples.
   User Input  Boldface type in interactive examples
               indicates information you enter from the

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Preinstallation Tasks

This section covers the tasks you must perform before installing DECtalk
Software. Topics include:

* Accessing the release notes (see Accessing the Release Notes, page 12)

* Checking installation procedure requirements (see Installation Procedure
Requirements, page 18)

* Hardware requirements (see Hardware Requirements, page 18)

* Checking current disk space (see Checking Current Disk Space, page 19)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Accessing the Release Notes

DECtalk Software provides release notes. The release notes contain
information about changes to DECtalk Software for Digital UNIX. Digital
strongly recommends that you read these release notes before using the
product. See the Compact Disc User's Guide shipped with your media for
instructions about how to access the release notes prior to the software
installation.

The release notes for DECtalk Software are in the following files after the
DTKRTRELNOTES420 subset is installed:

/usr/opt/DTKRT420/docs/ascii/release_notes_rt.txt
/usr/opt/DTKRT420/docs/postscript/release_notes_rt.ps

Use the following command to read the release notes for DECtalk Software
after the DTKRTRELNOT420 subset is installed:

# more /usr/opt/DTKRT420/docs/ascii/release_notes_rt.txt

You can also print either file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Registering Your Software Licenses

DECtalk Software includes support for the License Management Facility
(LMF). You must register your license product authorization keys (License
PAKs) in the license database (LDB) in order to use DECtalk Software on a
newly licensed system. The License PAKs is shipped with the kit if you
ordered the licenses and media together; otherwise, they are shipped
separately to a location specified on your license order.

Note

You must have superuser privileges to install the DECtalk Software and to
register the license PAK.

If you are installing DECtalk Software as an update on a node already
licensed for this software, you have already completed the License PAK
registration requirements.

To register a license under the Digital UNIX operating system:

Log in as root.

At the superuser prompt, edit an empty PAK template with the lmf register)
command as follows, and include all the information on your License PAK:

# lmf register
LMF displays a blank template and invokes an editor to allow you to edit
the template. LMF invokes the editor that is defined by your EDITOR
environment variable. If the environment variable is undefined, LMF invokes
the vi editor.

You must enter the license information from the PAK accurately.

When you finish entering the license data, exit from the editor. If the
license data is correct, LMF copies it into the license Database. If the
license data is incorrect, you may reenter the editor and correct mistakes.

Alternatively, you can create a command script enclosing the license
information (the license information is in the cover letter with this kit)
found between

lmf register - << ENDLMF
and

ENDLMF
Execute this script as root.

After you register your license, use the following commands to copy the
license details from the license database (LDB) to the kernel cache:

# lmf load 0 DECTALK-SW
For complete information on using the License Management Facility, see the
Guide to Software License Management and the lmf reference page.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Checking the Software Distribution Kit

Use the bill of materials (BOM) to check the contents of your DECtalk
Software software distribution kit.

In addition to this guide, the software distribution kit includes the
following:

CD-ROM optical disc for systems with optical disc drives

CD-ROM booklet

If your software distribution kit is damaged or incomplete, contact your
Digital representative.

See the DECtalk Software for Digital UNIX Software Product Description
(SPD) for additional hardware requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Software Requirements

DECtalk Software for Digital UNIX Version 4.2A requires the Digital UNIX
operating system Version 3.x or 4.0.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Checking Current Disk Space

To check the current amount of free space for a directory path, log in to
the system where you will install DECtalk Software. You can check which
directories are mounted and their locations by viewing the /etc/fstab file.
For example:

# more /etc/fstab
/dev/rz3a / ufs rw 1 1
/dev/rz3g /usr ufs rw 1 2
/dev/rz3b swap1 ufs sw 0 2

The display indicates that /usr mounted on /dev/rz3g is the only mount
point that affects where DECtalk Software files will reside; the system has
only one local disk drive, and the /usr/opt file system resides in the g
partition of the disk on that drive.

To check the total space and the free space for the directories where
DECtalk Software will reside, enter the df command. Given the previous
display of the /etc/fstab) file, which shows that only /usr is a mount
point, you need to check free space only in the /usr file system. For
example:

# df /usr
Filesystem 512-blocks Used Avail Capacity Mounted on
/dev/rz3a 79608 45648 25998 64% /
/dev/rz3g 1482190 921846 412124 69% /usr

This display shows that there are 412124 kbytes free. This free space must
accommodate the subsets that you opt to install. If you choose to install
all the subsets in the DECtalk Software Runtime kit you will need
approximately 15Mbytes of free disk space. Of this, the two unsupported
subsets use:

* DECface 10 Mbytes

* Emacspeak 1 Mbyte

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Increasing Disk Space by Using Alternative Disks

The DECtalk Software installation procedure creates and loads files into
the subordinate directory:

/usr/opt/DTKRT420

If any of the previously listed directories already exists, the
installation procedure uses it.

If you find that there is insufficient disk space for the DECtalk Software
subsets and you know that you have additional space on alternative disks or
disk partitions for your system, perform the following steps before
installing DECtalk Software:

Log in as superuser.

Create the following directory:

/usr/opt/DTKRT420)

Specify in the /etc/fstab file that one or more of the newly created
directories are mount points to new disk partitions where there is
additional space.

Enter the mount -a command so that the new mount points take effect.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Installation Tasks

This section covers the tasks you must perform to install DECtalk Software.

Topics include:

Using the CD-ROM consolidated distribution media (see Using the CD-ROM
Consolidated Distribution Media, page 21)

Responding to installation procedure prompts (see Starting the Installation
Procedure, page 22)

Selecting subsets (see Selecting Subsets, page 23)

Using a RIS distribution area (see Using an RIS Distribution Area, page 21)

Starting the installation procedure (see Starting the Installation
Procedure, page 22)

Stopping the installation (see Stopping the Installation, page 29)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] name="Rtftoc12">Using the CD-ROM Consolidated Distribution Media

The following procedure loads DECtalk Software files onto a disk belonging
to the system where you perform the installation. When DECtalk Software is
run, its executable images are mapped into memory on your system.

To install DECtalk Software from CD-ROM media:

Mount the media on the appropriate disk drive.

Log in as superuser login name root to the system where you will install
DECtalk Software.

Make sure that you are at the root (/) directory by entering the following
command:

# cd /
Specify the /cdrom directory to be the mount point for the distribution
file system on the drive. If your drive is rz4c, enter the following
command:

# mount -dr /dev/rz4c /cdrom
Enter a setld) command that requests the load function -l and identifies
the directory in the mounted file system where DECtalk Software subsets are
located. For example, if the directory location for these subsets is
/cdrom/DTK420/kit, enter the following command:

# /usr/sbin/setld -l /cdrom/DTK420/kit

The installation procedure now displays the names of DECtalk Software
subsets and asks you to specify the subsets you want to load.

See Starting the Installation Procedure, page 22 to continue the
installation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Using an RIS Distribution Area

If you are installing DECtalk Software subsets that reside in an /etc/ris
RIS distribution area on a remote system, take the following steps:

Log in as superuser login name root to the system where you will install
DECtalk Software.

Make sure that you are at the root directory (/) by entering the following
command:

# cd /
Enter a setld command that requests the load function (-l) option and
identifies the system where the DECtalk Software subsets are located. For
example, if you are loading DECtalk Software subsets from a RIS
distribution area on node axpmme, enter the following:

/usr/bin/setld -l axpmme

RIS now displays a menu that lists all the software subsets available to
you and asks you to specify the subsets you want to load.

See Starting the Installation Procedure on page 22 to continue the
installation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Starting the Installation Procedure

Before starting the installation procedure, log in as a superuser and
verify that you are at the root directory. Check to see if there are any
previously installed DECtalk Software subsets by entering the following
command:

% su root
# cd /
# /usr/sbin/setld -i | grep DTK

Deinstall any installed subsets with the prefix DTK by entering the
following command:

# cd /
# /usr/sbin/setld -d (name of subset)

To start the installation procedure, enter the following command:

# /usr/sbin/setld -l /dev/rmt0h

Then, respond to the installation procedure prompts as described in
Selecting Subsets on page 23.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Selecting Subsets

The following section presents a complete installation procedure, including
all messages that are displayed on your screen during the installation.

You must specify which DECtalk Software subsets you want to load. If you
specify more than one number at the prompt, separate each number with a
space, not a comma.

# /usr/sbin/setld -l /cdrom/DTK420/kit

The subsets listed below are optional:
There may be more optional subsets than can be presented on a single
screen. If this is the case, you can choose subsets screen by screen or all
at once on the last screen. All of the choices you make will be collected
for your confirmation before any subsets are installed.

1) DECface, A Talking Articulated Face - Sample Program (unsupported).
2) DECtalk Software V4.2A for Digital UNIX CDE Integration.
3) DECtalk Software V4.2A for Digital UNIX Release Notes.
4) DECtalk Software V4.2A for Digital UNIX Runtime Kit.
5) DECtalk Software V4.2A for Digital UNIX Runtime Users Guide.
6) Emacspeak, Speech Enabled Emacs - Sample Program (unsupported).

Or you may choose one of the following options:

7) ALL of the above
8) CANCEL selections and redisplay menus
9) EXIT without installing any subsets

Enter your choices or press RETURN to redisplay menus.

Choices (for example, 1 2 4-6): 7

Next, the script lets you verify your choice. For example, if you enter 7
in response to the previous prompt, you will see the following display:

You are installing the following optional subsets:

DECface, A Talking Articulated Face - Sample Program.

DECtalk Software V4.2A for Digital UNIX CDE Integration.

DECtalk Software V4.2A for Digital UNIX Release Notes.

DECtalk Software V4.2A for Digital UNIX Runtime Kit.

DECtalk Software V4.2A for Digital UNIX Runtime Users Guide.

Emacspeak, Speech Enabled Emacs - Sample Program.

Is this correct? (y/n):

If the displayed subsets are not the ones you intended to choose, enter n.
In this case, the subset selection menu is displayed again and you can
correct your choice of optional subsets. If the displayed subsets are the
ones you want to load, enter y. After you respond to this question, the
rest of the installation proceedes automatically and all the selected
subsets are loaded. A sample of the rest of the installation script is
listed below.

Checking file system space required to install selected subsets:

File system space checked OK.

6 subset(s) will be installed.

[Image] Stopping the Installation

To stop the installation procedure at any time, enter Ctrl/C. Then,
interactively delete the files created by the installation up to the point
where you stopped the installation. The directories and files created
during the DECtalk Software installation are listed in the following file:

/usr/opt/DTKRT420/docs/ascii/filelist.txt
If you encounter any failures during installation, see Reporting Problems,
page 32.

You may interrupt the installation procedure at any point. However, if you
do, the installation may not be left in a useful state. Remove all the
subsets you installed and reinstall them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Post-Installation Tasks

This section explains what you need to do after the installation to make
DECtalk Software ready for use. Topics include:

* Running the installation verification procedure (see Running the
Installation Verification Procedure , page 30)

* Deleting DECtalk Software from your system (see Deleting DECtalk Software
from Your System, page 30)

* Displaying documentation from the CD-ROM distribution disk. (see
Displaying Documentation from the CD-ROM Distribution Disc, page 31)

* Solving problems during product installation (see Correcting Problems
During Product Installation , page 31)

* Failures during product use. (see Reporting Problems, page 32)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Running the Installation Verification Procedure

You can run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) during the
installation or you can run the IVP independently after installing DECtalk
Software to verify that the software is available on your system. You might
also want to run the IVP after a system failure to be sure that users can
access DECtalk Software.

To run the IVP command:

% su root
#/usr/sbin/setld -v DTKRT420

The DECtalk Software IVP verifies the installation as follows:

A check for a valid LMF license is made. If no license is found, the IVP
fails because the software cannot be tested.

DECtalk Software requires that the Multimedia Software for Digital UNIX
server mmeserver be up and running. If the mmeserver is not already running
then the IVP fails. Start the server and try again. To start the server
follow the sequence shown below:

% su root
# mmeserver&
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Deleting DECtalk Software from Your System

If you must remove a version of DECtalk Software from your system, delete
each subset that you previously installed.

For example to delete a subset, do the following:

Log in as superuser login name root, as follows:

% su root
Verify that you are at the root directory (/) by entering the following
command:

# cd /
Enter the following form of the setld) commands:

# setld -i | grep DTK
Look for the word installed in the listing produced, and then delete the
installed subsets. For example:

# setld -d DTKRT420 DTKDEV420
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Displaying Documentation from the CD-ROM Distribution Disc

The DECtalk Software documentation is provided on the Digital UNIX Layered
Products Online Documentation CD-ROM in Bookreader (.decw_book) file
format. You can display the Bookreader files on your workstation using the
DECwindows Bookreader application. For information on accessing and
displaying these files, see the Digital UNIX Layered Products Disc User's
Guide.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Correcting Problems During Product Installation

If errors occur during the installation, the system displays failure
messages. For example, if the installation fails due to insufficient disk
space, a message similar to the following is displayed:

There is not enough space for subset SUBSET_NAME
SUBSET_DESCRIPTION (SUBSET_NAME) will not be loaded.
where:

SUBSET_NAME is the name of the subset
SUBSET_DESCRIPTION is the description of the subset
For example, DTKRTRELNOT420 is a subset name and DECtalk Software for
Digital UNIX Release Notes V4.2A is a subset description.

Errors can occur during the installation if any of the following conditions
exist:

  1. Operating system version is incorrect.

  2. Prerequisite software version is incorrect.

  3. Disk space is insufficient.

  4. System parameter values for successful installation are insufficient.

For descriptions of error messages generated by these conditions, see the
Digital UNIX documentation on system messages, recovery procedures, and
software installation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Reporting Problems

If an error occurs while DECtalk Software is in use and you believe the
error is caused by a problem with the product, take one of the following
actions:

If you have a Software Product Services Support Agreement, contact your
Customer Support Center (CSC) by telephone or by using the electronic means
provided with your support agreement (such as DSNlink). The CSC provides
telephone support for high-level advisory and remedial assistance. When you
initially contact the CSC, indicate the following:

  1. The name and version number of the operating system you are using

  2. The version number of DECtalk Software you are using

  3. The hardware system you are using (such as a model number)

  4. A brief description of the problem (one sentence, if possible)

  5. How critical the problem is

  6. If you have a Self-Maintenance Software Agreement, you can submit a
     Software Performance Report (SPR).

  7. If you do not have any type of software services support agreement and
     you purchased DECtalk Software within the past year, you can submit an
     SPR if you think the problem is caused by a software error.

     When you submit an SPR, take the following steps:

  8. Describe as accurately as possible the circumstances and state of the
     system when the problem occurred. Include the description and version
     number of the DECtalk Software being used. Explain the problem with
     specific examples.

  9. Reduce the problem to its elements.

 10. Remember to include listings of any command files, include files,
     relevant data files, and so forth.

 11. Provide a listing of the program.

     If the program is longer than 50 lines, submit a copy of it on
     machine-readable media (floppy diskette or magnetic tape). If
     necessary, also submit a copy of the program library used to build the
     application.

     For information about submitting media, see the tar(1) reference page.

 12. Report only one problem per SPR. This will facilitate a faster
     response.

 13. Mail the SPR package to Digital.

     If the problem is related to DECtalk Software documentation, you can
     do one of the following:

 14. Report the problem to the CSC (if you have a Software Product Services
     Support Agreement and the problem is severe).

 15. Fill out the Reader's Comments form (located at the back of the
     document that contains the error) and send the form to Digital. Be
     sure to include the action and page number where the error occurs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Overview

DECtalk Software extends the capabilities of your workstation by turning
text files into spoken words. It can accurately read ASCII text from a
variety of sources, such as electronic mail and word processors, using a
standard audio device for output. Nine different voices are provided and
users can control voice pitch, rate of speech, and word or phrase emphasis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] DECtalk Software Features

DECtalk Software provides the following features:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Latest Version of Digital Speech Synthesis Technology

DECtalk Software contains the latest version of DECtalk Software speech
synthesis. This incorporates a number of improvements from earlier versions
of DECtalk Software and is a software-only version of DECtalk Software
offered by Digital.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Letter Mode, Word Mode, and Clause Mode

DECtalk Software can immediately speak single characters without waiting
for an entire clause to be buffered. This feature is useful in applications
requiring tactile feedback for what was entered on the keyboard. It also
provides normal clause buffering for natural speech. DECtalk Software can
speak letters, words, phrases, clauses, paragraphs, and whole documents.
DECtalk Software allows the application to terminate speech immediately
instead of waiting for the buffered text to complete processing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Short Command Strings

Many of the command strings, such as change rate, change voice, start,
stop, and index marks can be abbreviated for greater ease of use in
applications.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] High-Quality Speech and Word Pronunciation

DECtalk Software speech retains its high quality. In addition, a number of
improvements have been made in functionality and acoustic phonetic quality.

The accuracy of word pronunciation is higher than in any previous version
of DECtalk Software. There have been significant improvements in the
accuracy and quality of letter-to-phoneme rules. Also, DECtalk Software has
a large built-in dictionary that is used in the accurate pronunciation of
individual words as well as enhancing their rhythmic naturalness.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Pronunciation Heuristics

Certain heuristics have been improved and made more intelligent. For
example, DECtalk Software is able to recognize and parse unpronounceable
sequences such as uppercase initials (FBI, AAA, and so forth) in addition
to the normal unpronounceable sequences such as those with no vowels (CBS
or NBC, for example).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] DECtalk Software API

The Text-To-Speech API is the Digital extension to Multimedia Services for
Digital UNIX. You can use this API to write your own applications. You will
need the DECtalk Software Development kit in order to access the APIs.

The API function set gives you a flexible method of manipulating DECtalk
Software functionality from within your application. These functions
perform a wide range of tasks associated with the Text-To-Speech system.
See DECtalk Software Programmer's Reference Guide (QA-228AA-WZ.4.2A) for a
complete list of API functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Voice-Control Commands

DECtalk Software programming aids include Voice-Control commands, also
called inline commands. These commands can be used to perform simple
voice-control operations, such as changing the speaking rate or speaking
voice while DECtalk Software is speaking, or more complex operations, such
as modifying the characteristics of each voice, controlling intonation and
stress within written text, or creating special effects such as singing.
Commands are inserted into ASCII text files displayed in one of the program
applets or directly into the application sources through the API functions.

Commands have special syntax rules and components that you need to use when
you insert them into files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] DECtalk Software Dictionaries

DECtalk Software has two pronunciation dictionaries: a large internal
(built-in) dictionary and an optional user-defined dictionary. With the
large built-in dictionary, developers can easily use many proper names and
normally unpronounceable sequences, such as uppercase initials, in their
applications. With the user dictionary build tool, developers can load
application-specific words, or cultural- or language-specific terms into
the user dictionary. A sample user-dictionary file is installed with the
software.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] DECtalk Software Components

The DECtalk Software components now installed on your system include:

   * A sample applet

   * Some sample programs

   * A user dictionary builder

   * Two unsupported sample programs

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Sample Applet

A sample applet, called speak, is bundled along with the DECtalk Software
kit. This applet demonstrates the capabilities of DECtalk Software. A
detailed description on the use of speak is provided in the next chapter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Sample Programs

DECtalk Software comes with several sample programs. These are:

   * say

   * mailtalk

   * aclock

   * DECface

   * emacspeak

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] say Program

The say program is a command-line program that produces synthesized audio
of the input ascii text. It has the following command line switches:

say [-h] [-s #] [-r #] [-d #] [file] [-a "text"]

-a "text" This command line switch is followed by the quoted string.
The text in the quoted string is spoken, at the end of which
the program returns to the Digital UNIX command prompt.

-d # Is used to select the audio output device.
-e # Is used to select the the output wave file format. Integers
1 to 3 are valid input to this option and they specify the
following:

1. PCM, 16 bit Mono 11 KHz format
2. PCM, 8 bit Mono 11 KHz format
3. Mu-law, 8 bit Mono 8 KHz format

-f <filename> Output wave file name
-h Displays the command line parameter list
-r # Speaking rate (75 - 650)
-s # Speaker number (1-9)
<filename> Name of an input ascii file to synthesize.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] mailtalk Program

The mailtalk is a program applet included with DECtalk Software that
announces the arrival of mail messages as they are delivered to your
system. Depending on the options you select, mailtalk announces the sender
of the message, its subject, or both. A more detailed explanation of this
program is presented in next chapter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] aclock Program

aclock announces the time of the day. It takes the following command line
parameters:

aclock [-h] [ # ]
where # is the interval in minutes
5 - every five minutes
15 - every fifteen minutes
30 - on the hour and half hour
60 - on the hour
-h - Displays the command line parameter list
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] User Dictionary Program (windict)

The user dictionary program, windict, is used to create special dictionary
files. The dictionary file contains words which have special user-specified
pronunciation rules. Dictionary work files are compiled into dictionaries

[Image] Unsupported Applications

The following unsupported applications are shipped with DECtalk Software
4.2A. Unsupported applications are provided to demonstrate the advanced
capabilities of DECtalk Software. They are provided for demonstration
purposes only and are not fully supported by Digital Equipment Corporation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] DECface

DECface is a computer-generated, synthetic face that synchronizes facial
movements to synthesized speech provided by DECtalk. As DECtalk generates
speech, DECface displays the facial expressions of a human actually
speaking those words.

DECface offers the ability to develop a large variety of new applications
by combining the audio functionality of a speech synthesizer with the
graphical functionality of a computer-generated face. A synthetic character
can give multimedia presentations, or monitor a system and report anomalies
as a feedback agent.

DECface enhances DECtalk by providing an obvious and immediate visual
feedback mechanism. In particular, multimedia projects involving direct
user interaction can be enhanced to better attract and maintain the
attention of viewers.

Specific information on how to invoke and use DECface can be found in the
documents located in:

/usr/opt/DTKRT420/decface/docs
or by typing:

man DECface.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Emacspeak

Emacspeak uses text-to-speech extensively to provide emacs with access for
the visually impaired. Emacspeak is context sensitive emacs extension that
intelligently reads the contents of the screen rather than just scanning
the screen and literally reading characters off the screen.

Information on how to use emacspeak is provided in the documents located in
the directory:

/usr/opt/DTKRT420/emacspeak/docs
or by typing:

man emacspeak

[Image] DECtalk Software: How are the Components Used?

DECtalk Software applications and application-building components are
targeted at two specific audiences: the application builder and the
application user.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] By the Programmer

As a DECtalk Software developer, you can use the DECtalk Software API calls
to create a DECtalk Software application. The DECtalk Software API is made
avilable in a separate product, the DECtalk Software Development kit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] By the Application User

The DECtalk application user accesses the application through the Motif
windows environment or at the Digital UNIX command line. DECtalk Software
also provides a CDE integration subset that can be installed on systems
that support CDE. DECtalk Software provides several methods of control. The
user can use the abbreviated command set provided with the application to
control basic operations, such as, the speaking rate or the speaking voice.
The user can also use the user dictionary to fine-tune the application's
basic pronunciation and voice characteristics. Finally, the user can also
embed in-line commands into text files to control DECtalk operations. Refer
to the specific sections for more information on which method to use.

[Image] How DECtalk Software Works

DECtalk Software converts ASCII English language text into speech output
through a speech synthesizer. There are two ways to feed text into the
speech synthesizer: through the user interface or through the API. The flow
of the text-to-speech process is explained below.

Figure: Flow of the DECtalk Software Text-to-Speech Conversion Process

Legend for Figure: Action of the DECtalk Software Module

  1. A sentence parser breaks the input stream into separate words and
     locates some clause boundaries (indicated by commas and other
     punctuation marks as well as by special words loaded in the DECtalk
     Software internal dictionary). The sentence parser also recognizes and
     deals with phonemic symbols and commands that you might have added to
     the input text.

  2. A word parser breaks words into their component parts, dividing words
     by their final pronounceable form. Strings of text that do not form
     pronounceable English words are spelled out letter by letter. A number
     formatter is used if the text contains numerals. The number formatter
     applies the rules for many common number formats and converts the
     numbers into English words. The number formatter also recognizes many
     common abbreviations, such as lb for pound.

  3. A dictionary lookup routine searches the pronunciation dictionaries.
     DECtalk Software has a built-in dictionary of many commonly used
     words. DECtalk Software also has a user dictionary that can be filled
     with words specific to an application. This dictionary and how to load
     it are described in Chapter 3. While this version of DECtalk Software
     has greater pronunciation accuracy than its predecessors, it may
     sometimes be necessary to send DECtalk Software the correct phonemics
     for words important for a particular application. This can be done by
     using the user dictionary.

  4. A phrase structure module recombines all phonemic output from the
     dictionary search and other modules. Durations of phonemes and pitch
     commands are computed for the clause, and appropriate sound variants
     are selected for those phonemes that can be pronounced in more than
     one way.

  5. A letter-to-sound module uses a set of English pronunciation rules to
     assign phonemic form and lexical stress patterns to words not found in
     the dictionary.

  6. The phoneme-to-voice module processes clauses passed from the phrase
     structure module and converts them to control signals for the speech
     synthesizer. This module modifies the clauses by changing the
     phonemes/allophones into parameters that determine the natural
     resonant frequencies of the vocal tract (formats), and sound source
     amplitudes. The control parameters are sent to the speech synthesizer
     for output.

  7. The Digital speech synthesizer computes a speech wave form with
     acoustic characteristics that are determined by the synthesizer
     control commands received.

Chapter 3: Getting Started [Image]

This chapter provides an introduction to basic voice and program control
operations. It gives you step-by-step instructions on how to perform each
operation. Basic operations are explained from the perspective of the
application user. That approach gives you a feel for using DECtalk Software
whether you are using the sample program or inserting commands on the
Digital UNIX command line.

Inserting Voice-Control Commands (Syntax Rules)

Before you can use DECtalk Software commands to modify speech output, you
need to know the proper syntax with which to include those commands into a
text file. Figure 3-2 illustrates the rules of DECtalk Software command
syntax.

Figure 1-2 -- Rules for Voice-Control Command Syntax

Click here for Picture

Legend
    Enclose every command in brackets.
    Begin every command with a colon.
    Separate each command and its parameter or parameters
    from the text by a valid word boundary marker, such as a
    space, tab, or carriage return. A space is used here.
    You can include several commands within the same
    brackets.
    Include several parameters within the same brackets if
    the command allows more than one parameter. If you use
    several parameters, enter each command's parameters
    before you enter a second command in the same bracket.
    (In this example, the parameter group modifies the [:dv]
    command.)
    If you give two conflicting parameters or commands
    Rhythm:control ofSyllabic stress:control ofDECtalk
    Software uses the last command in the sequence. (In this
    example, Rhythm:control ofSyllabic stress:control
    ofDECtalk Software uses Paul's voice.)
    You can use phonemic symbols within the same brackets
    with voice commands. In this example, the phonetic
    spelling of word really (r"iyliy) is included.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Additional Syntax Rules

If the value in a [:dv] command is too low, DECtalk Software uses the
minimum valid value. If the value is too high, it uses the maximum valid
value.

Once you enter a command, that command applies to the remaining text until
it is overridden by another command. For example, the command [:nk] invokes
Kit's voice on all entered text until you enter another voice-selection
command.

Invalid commands are ignored. By setting the [:error speak] command, you
can receive an audible warning that an invalid command has been entered.

DECtalk Software interprets text between brackets as phonemes only after
the [:phoneme arpabet speak on] command has been sent to the application.
If [:phoneme arpabet speak on] has not been sent DECtalk Software
interprets the brackets and characters between them literally. The
[:phoneme arpabet speak off] command must be sent with literal characters
if you want to insert brackets in normal text.

If the command [:phoneme arpabet speak on] is set and you forget the right
bracket ( ] ), DECtalk Software attempts to interpret all text following
the ASCII text as phonemes, skipping over illegal letter combinations. The
resulting text sounds garbled. Enter a right bracket to fix this problem.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Changing Voice Selections

You can change a speaking voice by inserting DECtalk Software commands into
the text-collection area displayed in the speak applet window or by
selecting text and then clicking on one of the nine picture buttons at the
top of the speak window.

Voice changes made with commands are permanent for the session and remain
intact as along as the command remains in the file. Voice changes made from
the menu only remain in effect as long as the current DECtalk Software
session is running.

Each voice selection is inserted into the command [:n x] where x is a value
representing one of the voices. Table 3-2 -- Changing Voices, lists the
names and their corresponding values.

You can change voices with a new voice command as in the following example.

[:nb] Hello. I'm Betty.

You can also change voices in the middle of a sentence.

[:np] This is a demo [:nb] of a sudden change in voice.

If a voice-change request occurs in the middle of a sentence, DECtalk
Software automatically pauses. The pause is the equivalent of inserting a
comma, or about half a second.

[:np] This is a demo, [:nb] of a sudden change in voice.

[Image] Overview of the User Dictionary Build Tool

The User Dictionary Build Tool creates a loadable dictionary file (.dic)
from a list of words and their corresponding pronunciations. The dictionary
is loaded with a call to the TextToSpeechLoadUserDictionary() function or
from the File menu in the Speak Program applet.

The Translate command is new for DECtalk version 4.2A. Use it to create
phonemic translations of words or phrases.

[Image] Building a User Dictionary

Building a user dictionary is a two-step process. First you create a .tab
source file with the User Dictionary Build Tool to define the pronunciation
of special words you want to place in the dictionary. Then you compile the
.tab file to produce a .dic file. This file is loaded into a DECtalk
Software session through the Speak applet or an API call.

[Image] Running mailtalk

The mailtalk program applet is included with DECtalk Software and announces
the arrival of mail messages as they are delivered to your system.
Depending on the options you select, mailtalk announces the sender of the
message, its subject, or both.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Mailtalk.ini File

The installation procedure places the default mailtalk.ini file in the
directory /usr/lib/dtk/. The .ini file contains the boilerplate text that
is spoken by mailtalk. You may modify this and place it in your login
directory. mailtalk first looks in your login directory for a mailtalk.ini
file; if it does not find one then it uses the default mailtalk.ini file in
/usr/lib/dtk/.

Standard DECtalk Software voice-control commands can be embedded in the
text strings to control attributes, such as speaking voice and speaking
speed. See Chapter 4 for information about DECtalk Software in-line
commands. The maximum length of any string is 256 characters. Characters
beyond 256 are truncated. The format for the ini file is as follows:

[mailtalk]

INCOMING = You have just received a mail message

UNREAD = You have unread mail messages

FROM = from

SUBJECT = In regards to

INIT = [:np :ra 180]

Upon receving an incomming mail message mailtalk will first speak out the
INCOMING mesage, in this case it will say - "You have just received a mail
message". mailtalk will then announce the FROM and finally the SUBJECT
fields. The DECtalk Software in-line commands in INIT set up the mailtalk,
in this case, to use Paul's voice at a rate of 180 words per minute.

Chapter 4:
Advanced Voice Control Topics

[Image]

This chapter provides an in-depth look at controlling voice characteristics
within a DECtalk Software text file or application.

Topics include:

* Using advanced voice modification commands

* Text-tuning example

* Developing an advanced speech application. DECtalk Software provides
several advanced methods of controlling speech output in addition to
changing the speaking voices and rearranging the text file format and
speaking sequence as dscussed in the previous chapter. These include:

* Changing rhythm, stress, and intonation with symbols

* Increasing or decreasing the speaking rate with the Rate Selection
command [:ra _]

* Controlling speech-pause durations with the Comma Pause [:cp _] and
Period Pause durations [:pp _] commands
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Changing Rhythm, Stress, and Intonation

DECtalk Software uses stress and syntactic symbols to control aspects of
rhythm, stress, and intonation patterns within a spoken text file. These
symbols include punctuation marks such as commas, periods, and open and
close parentheses. Punctuation marks are recognized by DECtalk Software as
indicating special phrasing requirements. Table 4-1 and Table 4-2 list
these symbols.

Table 4-1 -- Stress Symbols

 Symbol   Name               Indicates
 [ ' ]    apostrophe         primary stress
 [ ` ]    grave accent       secondary stress
 [ " ]    quotation mark     emphatic stress
 [ / ]    slash              pitch rise
 [ \ ]    backslash          pitch fall
[ /  \ ]  slash and          pitch rise and fall
          backslash

Table 4-2 -- Syntactic Symbols

 Symbol   Name               Indicates
 [ - ]    hyphen             syllable boundary
 [ * ]    asterisk           morpheme boundary
 [ # ]    number sign        compound noun
 [ ) ]    close parenthesis  beginning of verb phrase
 [ , ]    comma              clause boundaryClause
                             boundary: defining symbol
 [ . ]    period             end of sentence
 [ ? ]    question mark      end of question
 [ ! ]    exclamation point  end of exclamation
 [ + ]    plus sign          new paragraph


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Speaking Rate

The default speaking rate is 180 words per minute. DECtalk Software
speaking rates now range from 75 to 600 WPM. Speaking rates can beadjusted
to be very slow, very fast, or anywhere in between by using the following
commands:

Valid speaking rates are between 75 and 600 in the [:ra ] command. Rates
specified outside this range are limited to the nearest legal value.

[:ra 120] Although the slowest possible rate is 75 wpm, 120 wpm is ideal
for situations where material such as a phone number has to be copied down
by a listener. Note that it might be frustrating to listen to extended
speech at slow rates unless the listener is actually copying down each
numeral.

[:ra 160] This rate is moderate [160 wpm]. It sounds a little slow, but is
sometimes preferred in certain examples. For example, when DECtalk Software
is speaking math equations or long lists of acronyms.

[:ra 180] This rate is the default rate for DECtalk Software (180 wpm). It
is ideal for listening to continuous text under optimal conditions.

[:ra 240] This rate is faster, (240 wpm). Practiced listeners might prefer
to skim material at this rate. Inexperienced listeners might not understand
every word at this rate.

[:ra 350] This rate is very fast, (350 wpm). In fact, it is too fast to
follow, but it does have applications in special circumstances where an
individual needs to scan sections of text quickly.

[:ra 550] This rate is the fastest usable rate. It is too fast for many
people to follow, but it does have applications for individuals who want to
scan text very quickly.

Changes in the speaking rate influence the duration and the number of
pauses in text, as well as the duration of individual phonemes. At rates
below 140 wpm, DECtalk Software inserts pauses at all phrase boundaries and
pauses, and inserts phonemes near the ends of phrases. At rates faster than
240 wpm, DECtalk Software deletes all pauses and shortens phonemes. (Near
the beginning of phrases, phonemes are fairly short at both slow and fast
speaking rates.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Adjusting Period and Comma Pause Durations

At the default speaking rate (180 wpm), DECtalk Software pauses about half
a second after a period in the text and about a sixth of a second after a
comma. However, pause durations are adjusted automatically when you change
the speaking rate.

In some situations, you might prefer a pause after a period without
changing the speaking rate. For example, to get DECtalk Software to read a
list of words at a normal rate with five-second pauses after each word (to
allow the listener to write them down), you can use one of the following
commands and end each word with a comma or a period:

[:pp 4500] Adds a period pause of 4500 ms (4.5 seconds) to the standard
half-second pause that occurs after a period in text. The total pause
between words is about five seconds. The accepted range for a period pause
is from -380 to 30000 ms. A negative value shortens the standard period
pause.

[:cp 4800] Adds a comma pause of 4800 ms (4.8 seconds) to the standard
sixth of a second pause that occurs after a comma in the text at normal
speaking rate. The total pause between words separated by a comma is about
five seconds. The accepted range for a comma pause is from -40 to 30000 ms.
Values specified outside this range are limited to the nearest legal value.

[:pp 0 :cp 0] Resets the period pause and comma pause to their normal
default values.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Text-Tuning Example

Even though DECtalk Software allows for natural text-to-speech synthesis,
the quality of speech can often be enhanced by giving it a more natural
flow. Much of this tuning involves the strategic placement of commas and
periods, which tell the application to pause, as a native speaker of
English does when speaking. The spoken language and written text are
different as spoken text generally does not contain information about
pausing.

The text that follows is presented twice, the first time as originally
written, and the second time after phonemic and textual fixes were applied.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Developing an Advanced Speech Application

The development process described in this guide assumes that your
application has full control of the text being spoken. However, if you are
developing an application that reads arbitrary text (such as electronic
mail messages), your task is more difficult because almost anything can
appear in the text. You can put application-specific text filters in the
controlling computer, rather than add many additional special cases (and
switches to enable and disable them) to DECtalk Software.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Developing an Electronic Mail-Reading Application

You can write an electronic mail preprocessor to make the following text
conversions before sending the text to DECtalk Software:

* Parse the header boiler plate to remove extraneous information.

* Add the new paragraph symbol [+] to each blank line between paragraphs if
DECtalk Software is speaking paragraphs of text.

* Create your own application-specific dictionary for words, such as proper
names, that DECtalk Software mispronounces. If DECtalk Software is
connected to a database containing names, consider adding a pronunciation
field to the name record or entering phonemic text when appropriate.
(DECtalk Software can handle many proper names and addresses using the
[:pronounce name] or [:mode name ] commands.)

* Scan the text for strings of numbers in a format understandable to your
application but not to DECtalk Software. For example, if you can extract
the time format from an electronic mail message, you can add code to your
application to expand it to its "o'clock" form.

* In many applications, the listener might want to write down number
strings (such as prices or telephone numbers). Your application can scan
the text for strings of numbers and, when found, send them to DECtalk
Software in such a way that includes pauses at critical locations.

For example:

The number is, 1 (800) 5 5 5, 1 2 3 4. [:ra 120]

That is, [_<300>] 1 (800), [_<500>] 5 5 5,

[_<900>] 1 2 3 4. [:ra 180].

The spaces between the numbers ensure that "five five five" is spoken
rather than "five hundred fifty five." (You can also use the [:mode spell
on] command. The slower speaking rate, [:ra 120], and the silence phonemes,
[_<300>], [_<500>], [_<900>], of specified durations, were carefully
selected to allow enough time for the listener to write down the entire
number. Silence phonemes were positioned after the commas (that is,
[_<300>] 1 (800), [_<500>]), to maintain appropriate intonation.

As another example, if your application is required to speak sums of money
(such as bank balances or item costs), you might code the text to say:

Your balance is $244.05. That is, 2 4 4, [_<400>] point 0 5, [_<400>]
dollars.

When spelling an item out, your application might need to distinguish the
case of letters. Consider using different voices to distinguish between
uppercase and lowercase letters. For example:

[:nf]Maynard [:nf]M[:nb]a y n a r d [:nf]Maynard.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Optimizing the Quality of Spoken Text

In some applications, it might be important to get a few sentences to sound
natural and pleasing to the listener because they hear them more often.
Therefore, you might want to improve the quality of a particular sentence.
The following steps are suggested:

1. Send the sentence to DECtalk Software and listen to it a number of
times, focusing on each word to detect any mispronunciations.

2. Change text to phonemic text for all mispronounced words.

Note
For words that have two pronunciations (homographs), see online help or
Appendix B.

DECtalk Software can choose the correct pronunciation by itself. For
example, if you enter the following sentences:

He produced a lot of REFUSE. He REFUSEd the produce.

He INSERTS 5 INSERTS per minute. He DELIBERATEd DELIBERATEly for a long
time.

You can see how some of these words could be pronounced incorrectly. You
can correct such mispronunciation by doing one of the following:

Replace the correct spelling of the word with a clever misspelling.

I red yesterday that . . .

Spell the word phonetically

I [r'ehd] yesterday that . . .

Additionally, use the following steps to optimize spoken text.

1. If the word is a compound, use a hyphenated spelling to help DECtalk
Software see the two parts of the compound.

The slide-show host . . .

2. Replace the text version by a phonemic string. Use the commands and
phonemic symbols, but make sure to place the lexical stress pattern
correctly.

Note
Sometimes, a word does not sound quite right even when the best phonemic
representation is selected. Usually, such subtle pronunciation defects are
not correctable.

3. Now that each word has been pronounced in the best possible way, listen
to the total sentence rhythm and accent pattern. If it is not right, follow
these steps.

(a) If it sounds like there should be a short pause in a particular
sentence location, but DECtalk Software says the sentence without a pause,
insert a comma between the words in question.

(b) If the wrong word is emphasized in the sentence, emphasize the word
that is suppose to take the emphasis with the correct stress symbols .

The ["] younger man is the trouble-maker, not the older one.

(c) Use the pitch control symbols slash [/], backslash [\], and slash and
backslash
[/ \] to make final adjustments.

(d) If none of these actions gives you a satisfactory sentence, you can
still specify duration and fundamental frequency motions for all phonemes
with the voice-control commands discussed fully in Chapter 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Avoiding Common Errors

When using DECtalk Software, try to avoid making two common errors by doing
the following:

* When making voice-selection changes, always return to the default voice
you have chosen.

If you forget to return DECtalk Software to the default voice after using
one of the other voices, all future text uses the currently selected voice.

* Enter a right bracket ( ] ) at the beginning of your text.

If the [:phoneme arpabet speak] command is entered allowing phonemic input,
it is possible for DECtalk Software to enter phonemic mode unintentionally
if the text being spoken contains an unexpected left bracket ( [ ), or if
you forget to enter a right ( ] ) bracket after a phonemic entry. DECtalk
Software is left in a state where it will interpret all remaining text
phonemically. For example:

] [:phone on] [:ra 220 [:nh] Ladies and Gentlemen

^ (right bracket ( ] ) is missing

Appendix A:
DECtalk Software Voice Control Commands

[Image]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image]Voice-Control Commands: Overview

DECtalk Software includes voice-control commands, also called inline
commands. You can use these commands to perform simple voice-control
operations, such as changing the speaking rate or speaking voice while
DECtalk Software is speaking. Commands are inserted into ASCII text files
displayed in one of the program applets or directly into the application
sources through the API functions.

DECtalk Software also has a more complex set of voice-control commands to
modify the characteristics of each voice, control intonation and stress
within written text, or to create special effects, such as singing.

Commands have special syntax rules and components that you need to use when
you insert them into files.

Commands are synchronous unless otherwise stated. Also, when you use
several commands together, they might interact with each other and affect
the output. If incorrect syntax is used in a command, the right bracket ( ]
) is ignored as it might be considered part of the illegal string. To fix
this situation, insert an extra right bracket ( ] ) in the command and set
the [:error] command on.

Table A-1 DECtalk Software Voice-Control Commands

                         module.
Period Pause              Inserts a pause equivalent to
                         a period in a sentence into
                         spoken text.
Phoneme Interpretation   Allows everything within
                         brackets to be interpreted as
                         phonemic text.

Rate Selection            Selects speed at which text is
                         spoken
Resume                   Resumes speech after a pause.
Say Mode                 Allows DECtalk to speak words
                         before they are queued.
Synchronization          Synchronizes activity between

Voice Selection           Selects the voice.
Volume                   Sets the volume.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image]Comma Pause

This command increases or decreases the length of the comma pause. Comma
pause can be increased and decreased. [:cp 0] resets the comma pause to its
default state (approximately 160 ms). Comma pauses can be increased to
30,000 ms and decreased to -40 ms. All values outside legal range default
to the nearest legal values.

SYNTAX

[:comma DDD] or [:cp DDD]

OPTIONS

None

PARAMETERS

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Index Mark

Index marks are used to report the progress of the text as it is spoken.
Index marks are position markers; they do not modify heuristics or word
pronunciations in any way. The index mark sequence inserts a flag into the
text stream. When DECtalk encounters an [:index mark 01] command, a message
is sent to the user's callback function corresponding to the callback
function passed in the TextToSpeechStartup() function. The LPARAM field of
the message contains the index value. The index mark value can be any
number between 00 and 99. If a callback function is not specified in the
TextToSpeechStartup() call, index marks in the text are ignored.

SYNTAX

[:index mark DD]

OPTIONS

None

PARAMETERS

Value = DD

DEFAULT

None

EXAMPLES

[:index mark 01]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Log

The in-line log command is used to log either text, phonemes, at a time.
This command will not open a file if any other Text-To-Speech file is open
or if the system is in speech-to-memory mode. In these cases, the in-line
[:log XX on] command will be discarded and the in-line [:log XX off]
command will cause an error.

Example;

[:log phonemes on] The phonemes for this sentence will be stored in a file
named log.txt [:log phoneme off]

SYNTAX

[:log xx yy]

OPTIONS

text      Log all text except escape sequences
          (Earlier versions of DECtalk Software
          used escape sequences for control).
syllable  Log converted syllables.
s
phonemes     Log converted phonemic text.

PARAMETERS

on (Absolute mode) off (Enable mode) set (Disable Mode)

DEFAULT

EXAMPLES

[:mode spell on]

Europe Mode Example

When mode is set to Europe, a comma (,) is the separator between the
integer and fraction part of a number. A period (.) is the separator
between three- digit blocks.

1.255 (United States) = 1,255 (Europe) 125,873 (United States) = 125.873
(Europe)

Math Mode Example

Math takes special symbols and characters and pronounces them with
mathematical meanings. Specifically, the following characters are treated
differently:

    Symbol      Name      DECtalk Software Says...
      +         plus      plus (no change from normal speech)
      -         hyphen    minus
      *         asterisk  multiplied by
      /         slash     divided by

      .         period    decimal point
    xxE-xx      (spelled  (scientific notation)
                )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Mode Name Example

Mode name allows uppercase words that occur in non sentence initial
position to be interpreted as special cases and pronounced as names.

Note

Do not enable [:mode name] except when pronouncing lists of names. Mode
Name interprets any uppercase word as a name. When finished, make sure that
this mode is set to OFF. For the occasional use of this utility, use the
[:pronounce name] command. Mode commands are asynchronous.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Pause

This command pauses the audio output. Any pending but unspoken text is
retained, including index marks that might have been sent by the
application. All text that occurs after the pause is not processed until
the pause time is exceeded. Unlike previous versions of DECtalk hardware
products, the in-line pause command is a synchronous command. This means
that all text which occurs after the pause is not processed until the pause
time is exceeded.

SYNTAX

[:pause DDD]

OPTIONS

None

PARAMETERS

Pause time in milliseconds; 0 = forever

DEFAULT

None

EXAMPLES

[:pause 1000] Pause for one second.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Period Pause

The length of the period pause can be increased and decreased with the
Period Pause command. This command [:pp 0] resets the period pause to its
default state (approximately 640 ms). Period pauses can be increased to
30,000 ms and decreased by -380 ms. All values outside the legal range
default to the nearest legal values.

SYNTAX

[:period DDD] or [:pp 0]

OPTIONS

None

PARAMETERS

Pause time in milliseconds

DEFAULT

640 ms

EXAMPLES

[:period 250]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Phoneme Interpretation

When set, this command allows everything within brackets to be interpreted
as phonemic text. When phonemicizing text, simply put legal phoneme strings
in brackets. This allows for the preferred pronunciation of a word or
phrase. This command is extremely important because it sets the left
bracket ( [ ) and right bracket ( ] ) characters as phoneme delimiters.
When this command is set, all text and characters that appear between
brackets is interpreted as phonemic text and is pronounced as such. This is
useful when you do not want to turn this command on but want to have
something read phonetically. For example, to say the word associate, simply
embed the phonemic string [axs'owshiyeyt] in the text string.

SYNTAX

[:phoneme XX YY] or [:phoneme on] or [:phoneme arpabet on]

OPTIONS

ASCI         Reserved for future use.
arpabet      Set phonetic interpretation to arpabet
             alphabet.
speak        Speak encountered phonemes.
silent       Do not speak encountered phonemes.

PARAMETERS

on       Set phoneme

[:phoneme arpabet speak on]

Note

Make sure that you use a right bracket after entering phonetic text when
this command is set. If you do not, any normal text appearing after the
right bracket will sound garbled. One right bracket is sufficient to close
phonemic mode. It is sometimes useful to begin a text file with a right
bracket (]) to ensure that text is not interpreted phonetically. Also, the
command sequence consisting of a left bracket followed by a colon ([:) is
always interpreted as the beginning of a voice command. Default for phoneme
mode is Off, and it must be turned On by a special command.[:phoneme on] is
an abbreviated version of the [:phoneme arpabet speak on] command.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Pronounce Alternate

This command pronounces the alternate pronunciation for the word
immediately following it. Use a [:pron alt] to obtain an alternative
pronunciation for a word listed in the Homograph table in Chapter 6. For
example, the primary pronunciation of the word wind is w'ihnd, as in 'the
wind is blowing'. The secondary pronunciation, denoted by [:pron alt] wind,
is w'aynd, as in 'wind up the top'.

[Image] Pronounce Name

This command pronounces the word immediately following it as a proper name.
First names, last names, street names, and place names are all examples of
proper names. This command can be used when DECtalk Software mispronounces
a proper noun.

Note

This command must be used each time a new name is encountered but is also
useful when the location of a name field is known.

[Image] Resume

Unlike previous versions of DECtalk hardware products the resume command is
a synchronous command. Thus the Resume command will not restart the system
after an in-line pause command. The in-line resume command may be used if
the computer is not fast enough to run real time and the amount of text is
not greater than approximately 256 characters. In this case the system
would be paused by the TextToSpeechPause() function before queuing text by
the TextToSpeechSpeak() function and the in-line resume command would be
placed at the end of the text message. If the text is too long then the
in-line resume command may never be processed.

Code Example:

TextToSpeechPause( phTTS ) /* Pause the system */

TextToSpeechSpeak( phTTS, "This is a slow computer. [:resume]", TTS_FORCE
);

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Say Mode

In DECtalk each clause, word, or letter is spoken as it is queued. In word
and letter mode, DECtalk does not need to wait for a clause terminator to
begin speaking. This command interacts with the rate selection command so
that you can set both rate selection and speak word or rate selection and
letter mode for the optimal output.

Word mode is similar to letter mode except text is spoken a word at a time.
A space after a character or string of characters causes that string to be
spoken. This mode interacts with the rate selection command so you can
increase or decrease the rate at which letters or words are spoken. In
clause mode, speaking starts when DECtalk is sent a clause terminator
(period, comma, exclamation point, or question mark) followed by a space.
There is no time-out limit. This is the normal mode where text is spoken a
phrase, clause, or sentence at a time. Clause mode is the default.

SYNTAX

[:say XX]

OPTIONS

EXAMPLES

[:say word]

Note

In [:say letter] mode, the left bracket is spoken only after the next
character is entered because DECtalk needs to know if this is the beginning
of a new command.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Comma Pause

This command increases or decreases the length of the comma pause. Comma
pause can be increased and decreased. [:cp 0] resets the comma pause to its
default state (approximately 160 ms). Comma pauses can be increased to
30,000 ms and decreased to -40 ms. All values outside legal range default
to the nearest legal values.

[Image] Volume

DECtalk changes the audio system gain in increments from 0 to 99.
Increments or decrements of 10 to 20 provide a perceptual increase or
decrease in volume. The volume command is an absolute command; [volume up]
and [volume down] are relative commands and increase or decrease the
original value. This does not affect the volume when writing wave files or
using the speech-to- memory capability.

Stereo Volume Control

The following monaural volume commands were supported in DECtalk Software
V4.1.

[:volume set XX] Set left and right channel volume to XX
[:volume up XX] Raise left and right channel volume by XX
[:volume down XX] Lower left and right channel volume by XX

where XX is always from 0 to 99.

The following stereo commands have been added to DECtalk Software 4.2.

[:volume lset XX] Set left channel volume to XX
[:volume lup XX] Raise left channel volume by XX
[:volume ldown XX] Lower left channel volume by XX
[:volume rset XX] Set right channel volume to XX
[:volume rup XX] Raise right channel volume by XX
[:volume rdown XX] Lower right channel volume by XX
[:volume sset XX, YY] Set left channel volume to XX and right channel
volume to YY.

The volume commands are synchronous commands.
The volume may not be raised above 99 or lowered below 0.
Any attempt to do so will result in limiting to these values.

SYNTAX

This chapter provides reference information for phonemic symbols, stress
and syntactic symbols, singing tones, homographs, and American English
phoneme codes. This information is presented in table form and includes the
following.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image] Phonemic Symbols

The table below lists the phonemic alphabet that uses, along with an
example of each sound. Some dictionaries put the stress symbol after the
vowel nucleus or at the start of the syllable. However, DECtalk Software
requires that the stress symbol appear immediately before the vowel.

[Image] DECtalk Singing

DECtalk Software can be used to sing songs or make various sounds
associated with singing and musical tones. The Tone table provides the
pitch numbers, associated notes, and frequencies that you need to code a
phonemic sequence to produce musical sounds. The example that follows is
the code for the song, "Happy Birthday." The command syntax for coding
musical sequences is:

[phoneme<duration, pitch number>]

[Image] Homographs

Homographs are two or more words that have the same spelling but are
pronounced differently. These are often different in terms of which
syllable is accented. For example, if permit is a noun, the accent is on
the first syllable (permit); if, however, the word is used as a verb, then
the accent is on the second syllable (permit). This often makes a great
deal of difference in understanding DECtalk when it is speaking such words
in connected discourse.

The default is the more frequent form. In the event the alternate
pronunciation is needed, you can insert the correct phonetics from the
homograph index below. Use a [:pron alt] command to obtain an alternative
pronunciation for a word. For example, the primary pronunciation of the
word bass is b'eys, as in bass guitar. The secondary pronunciation is
denoted by [:pron alt]b'aes, as in the fish, bass. The secondary
pronunciation for the word wind, is w'aynd, as in 'wind up the top'.

[Image] American English Phoneme Codes

The American English Phoneme Codes are the phoneme values returned when
DECtalk performs speech-to-memory operations using the
TextToSpeechOpenInMemory() function. These symbols are referred to as
phonemes although many are actually allophones.

Glossary

allophone

A positional or free variant of a phoneme.

applet

A small application that normally performs a very specific function and can
be used with other larger applications.

arpabet

A special phonetic alphabet used to write phonemes and syllables.

clause boundary

The natural boundary between two or more clauses in a sentence that helps
the listener easily separate the sentence into its component parts. Commas,
periods, exclamation points, and question marks are symbols used to
indicate clause boundaries.

clause mode

The normal mode in which DECtalk Software speaks text a phrase, clause, or
sentence at a time. In clause mode, speaking starts when DECtalk Software
is sent a clause terminator (period, comma, exclamation point, or question
mark) followed by a space.

clause terminator

A symbol used to begin and terminate a clause boundary. Symbols can be
periods, commas, exclamation points, or question marks.

comma pause

The pause DECtalk Software takes in speaking that is equivalent to
inserting a comma in a sentence. Comma pause can be increased and decreased
with the Comma Pause command.

.DIC file

The loadable dictionary file created by the User Dictionary Build Tool from
a .tab source file.

emphatic stress

The emphasis placed on a syllable of a word to give it more meaning.

falling intonation

A decrease in voice pitch.

flush

Process by which the Text-To-Speech system discards data in the system.

heuristic

A method or rule used to decide among several courses of action. Often
called a "rule of thumb." In the case of DECtalk Software, pronunciation
heuristics govern the manner in which DECtalk Software pronounces words.

homograph

Pairs of words that have the same spelling but which are pronounced
differently. For example, the pronunciation of permit as a noun and the
pronunciation of permit as a verb.

index marker (flag)

A marker placed in the text stream to synchronize an external event. An
index marker is inserted with the Index Mark command.

intonation

The manner in which a voice imparts extra meaning to speech by adjusting
sounds' durations and voice pitch. For example, the emphasis and meaning of
the sentence, Bill, put in the edits. can be changed by putting stronger
emphasis on the name, Bill. Bill! Put in the edits!

letter mode

The state in which DECtalk Software speaks each letter as it is queued. In
word and letter mode, DECtalk Software does not need to wait for a clause
terminator to begin speaking. This command interacts with the rate
selection command so that you can set both rate selection and letter mode
for optimal output.

log file

A file that can contain text, phonemes, or syllables. The phonemes and
syllables are written using the arpabet phoneme alphabet.

morpheme

The minimum syntactic unit of a language that has an important role in
determining pronunciations. For example, "spell" has only one morpheme,
while "misspelling" is made up of three: "mis," "spell," and "ing."

period pause

The pause DECtalk Software inserts when it finds a period that marks the
end of the sentence. This pause imitates humans taking a breath. This pause
is approximately half a second.

phoneme

Smallest unit of speech that distinguishes one word from another. Phonemes
are divided into vowel and consonant phonemes. DECtalk Software Software
interprets text brackets as phonemes only after the phoneme arpabet command
is used.

phoneme arpabet command

A command that causes all text within brackets to be treate0d as phonemic
text.

phoneme string

Two or more phonemes together used to pronounce a special word or group of
words.

phonemicize

To encode words as strings of phonemes.

phonemic mode

A mode DECtalk Software software uses for speaking phoneme strings.

phonemic transcription

A word written the way it is pronounced is said to be in phonemic
transcription or simply in phonemics. When DECtalk Software says a word or
phrase not as you intended, you might need to use phonemic transcription to
get the desired pronunciation. For example, [r'ehd] is the phonemic
transcription of the word read.

phrase boundary

A clause boundary formed by terminating punctuation -- comma, period,
exclamation point, question mark -- followed by a space.

pitch control symbols

Symbols used to override built-in DECtalk Software pitch control. Symbols
include pitch rise [/], pitch fall [\], and pitch rise and fall [/ \].

primary stress

Most content words of English (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs)
contain one primary stressed syllable. The primary stress symbol in DECtalk
Software is the apostrophe [ ' ].

proper name

First names, last names, street names, company names, and place names are
all examples of proper names.

secondary stress

A symbol used to indicate a degree of stress that is between primary and
unstressed (no stress). The secondary stress symbol is the grave accent
[`].

silence phonemes

Silences of specified durations inserted into text files in the same manner
as you would insert a phoneme.

syntactic function words

A set of words that are either unstressed or have secondary stress. They
include prepositions, conjunctions, determiners, auxiliary verbs, pronouns,
question mark, and clause introducers. DECtalk Software uses stress and
syntactic symbols to control aspects of rhythm, stress, and intonation
patterns. These symbols include punctuation marks such as commas, periods,
question marks, and exclamation points.

.TAB file

The source file used to build a user dictionary.

user dictionary

The dictionary that you define so DECtalk Software can load and use with an
application to control the pronunciation of specific words processed by the
application.

user dictionary builder

A program applet included with DECtalk Software to build and compile user
dictionaries.

voice-control command

A DECtalk Software command inserted into text strings and used to control
basic and special Text-To-Speech functions, such as speaking voice and
speaking rate.

WAVE file

A Microsoft standard file format for storing wave form audio data. WAVE
files have a .WAV file extension.

wave form output

The digitized reproduction of a sound wave form. DECtalk Software produces
wave form output from the Speak program applet and the API, both of which
allow you to save an ASCII text file to .WAV file format.

word boundary

A white space character (space, tab, or carriage return) in the text that
indicates a boundary between words. DECtalk Software uses word boundary
symbols to select the word-beginning or word-ending allophone of a phoneme.

word mode

A text-processing mode where DECtalk speaks one word at a time. A blank
space or equivalent after a character or string of characters causes that
string to be spoken in word mode.
