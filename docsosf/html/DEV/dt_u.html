Preface: About this Guide</a></h2>

<p>
This guide contains instructions for the installation of the DECtalk Software product. It also contains the tutorial and reference information you need to build a  DECtalk Software application.

What's the Difference Between the DECtalk Software Runtime Kit and the 
DECtalk Software Development Kit?</h2></a>

DECtalk Software is packaged as a Runtime kit and a Development kit. The 
Runtime kit gives you access to the following DECtalk Software applications: 
mailtalk, say, speak, emacspeak, and DECface. 
In order to develop your own DECtalk Software applications, you must order the 
DECtalk Software Developer's kit. DECtalk Software Developer's kit gives you 
access to the DECtalk Software API and some sample C programs.<p>

<a href="#1_toc"><img align=bottom border=no src=yellowball.gif></a>
License Requirements</a></h2>

You can run one copy of any DECtalk Software application at a time without 
needing an LMF license. A license is required to run more than one copy of the 
Runtime kit or to use the DECtalk Software Development kit. See the section on 
LMF Licensing in Chapter 1 for more information.
