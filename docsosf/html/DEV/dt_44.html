The DECtalk Software voices provide an adequate selection for most
applications. However, if you have a special application requiring a monotone
or unusual voice, you can modify the parameters provided in this section to
design your own voice.<p>

<a name="RTFToC2"> Parameters [:dv_] </a></h2>
The nine built-in voices of DECtalk are distinguished from one another by a
large set of speaker-definition parameters.<p>
Speakers can differ in sex, age, head size and shape, larynx size and behavior,
pitch range, pitch and timing habits, dialect, and emotional state. DECtalk
Software cannot approximate all of these options. Therefore, the space of
distinguishable voices is limited, even though DECtalk Software has many
speaker-definition parameters that can be modified.<p>
The design voice [:dv _] command introduces the speaker-definition parameters
that can be entered as a string or one at a time.<p>
The following sections discuss speech production, acoustics, and perception.
Some of the information is relatively technical, but the examples should make
it possible for all developers to modify any parameter effectively and listen
to the results.

<a name="RTFToC3">Changing Sex and Head Size </a></h2>
Six speaker-definition parameters control the size and shape of the head. These
parameters are as follows are described later in this chapter.<p>


<pre>
sx    Sex 1 (male) or 0 (female)                             
hs    Head size, in %                                        
f4    Fourth formant resonance frequency, in Hz              
f5    Fifth formant resonance frequency, in Hz               
b4    Fourth formant bandwidth, in Hz                        
b5    Fifth formant bandwidth, in Hz                         
</pre>
<b>Sex, sx</b><p
Male and female voices have many differences, including head size,
pharynx length, larynx mass, and speaking habits such as degree of breathiness,
liveliness of pitch, choice of articulatory target values, and speed of
articulation. Some of these differences are under the control of a single
parameter, sx, the sex of the speaker. Speakers Paul, Harry, Frank, and Dennis
are male (sx = 1), while speakers Betty, Rita, Ursula, Wendy, and Kit are
female (sx = 0). Actually, Kit the Kid can be male or female because children
younger than 10 years old have similar voices for both sexes.<p>
Changing the sx parameter causes DECtalk Software to access a different (male
or female) table of target values for formant frequencies, bandwidths, and
source amplitudes. The male and female tables are patterned after two
individuals who were judged to have pleasant, intelligible voices. DECtalk
Software's built-in voices are simply scaled transformations of Paul and Betty,
the two basic voices.<p>
You can change the sex of any of DECtalk Software's voices by making the voice
current and then modifying the sx parameter. For example, the following command
gives Paul some of the speaking characteristics of a woman. (The sx parameter
does not change the average pitch or breathiness, so a peculiar combination of
simultaneous male and female traits results from this sx change.)<p>
<tt>[:np :dv sx 0] Am I a man or woman?</tt><p>
The sx parameter can also be specified as m or f with the commands
[:dv sx m] or [:dv sx f].<p>
                                                Note<br>If you change the sex
of the voice, some phonemes might cause DECtalk Software's filters to overload,
producing a squawk. The modification of certain parameters such as f4, f5, and
g1 (explained in a later section) can help to correct this problem.

<p>
<b>Head Size, hs</b><p
Head size (hs) is specified as the average size for an adult man (if sx
= 1) or an adult woman (if sx = 0). A head size of 100 % is normal or average
for a given sex, but people can differ significantly in this characteristic.
Head size has a strong influence on a person's voice. Large musical instruments
produce low notes, and humans with large heads tend to have low, resonant
voices. For example, to make Paul sound like a larger man with a 15 % longer
vocal tract (and formant frequencies that are scaled down by a factor of about
0.85 %), use the following command:<p>
<tt>[:np :dv hs 115] Do I sound more like Huge Harry this way?</tt><p>
Head size is one of the best variables to use if you want to make
dramatic voice changes. For example, Paul has a head size of 100, while Harry's
deep voice is caused in part by a head-size change to 115, or 15 % greater than
normal. Decreasing head size produces a higher voice, such as in a child or
adolescent. Extreme changes in head size, as in the following examples, are
somewhat difficult to understand.<p>
<tt>[:nh :dv hs 135] Do I have a swelled head?</tt><p>
<tt>[:nk] I am about 10 years old.</tt><p>
<tt>[:nk :dv hs 65] Do I sound like a six year old? </tt><p>
<p>
<b>Note	</b><p>
Extreme changes in head size can cause overloads, as well as
difficulties in understanding the speech. The modification of certain
parameters such as f4, f5, and g1 can help to correct this problem. (See the
next section)
<p>
<b>Higher Formants, f4, f5, b4, and b5</b><p>
A male voice typically has five prominent resonant peaks in the spectrum
(over the range from 0 to 5 kHz), a female voice typically has only four
(because of a smaller head size), and a child has three. If fourth and fifth
formant resonances exist for a particular voice, they are fixed in frequency
and bandwidth characteristics. These characteristics are specified (in HZ) by
the parameters f4, f5, b4, and b5, in Hz. <p>
If a higher formant does not exist, the frequency and bandwidth of the speaker
definition are set to special values that cause the resonance to disappear. To
make a resonance disappear, the frequency is set to above 5500 Hz and the
bandwidth is set to 5500 Hz. (This disables the formant filter.) This is what
has been done to the fourth and fifth formants for Kit.<p>
The permitted values for f4 and f5 have fairly complicated restrictions.
Violating these restrictions can cause overloads and squawks. The Following
restrictions apply to cases where a higher formant exists:<p>
F5 must be at least 300 Hz higher than f4.<p>
If sx is 1 (male), f4 must be at least 3250 Hz.<p>
If sx is 0 (female), f4 must be at least 3700 Hz.<p>
If hs is not 100, the preceding values should be multiplied by (h/ 100).<p>
These higher formants produce peaks in the spectrum that become more prominent
if b4 and b5 are smaller, and if f4 and f5 are closer together. The limits
placed on b4 and b5 should ensure that no problems occur. However, smaller
values for bandwidths may produce an overload in the synthesizer. You can
correct these overloads by increasing the bandwidths or by changing the gain
control g1.<p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Changing Voice Quality </a></h2>
Six speaker-definition parameters control aspects of the output of the larynx,
which, in turn, control voice quality. These parameters are listed as
follows:<p>

<pre>
br    Breathiness, in decibels (dB)                           
lx    Lax breathiness, in %                                   
sm    Smoothness, in %                                        
ri    Richness, in %                                          
nf    Number of fixed samples of open glottis                 
la    Laryngealization, in %                                  

</pre>
<p>
<b>Breathiness,
br</b><p>
Some voices can be characterized as breathy. The vocal folds vibrate to
generate voicing and breath noise simultaneously. Breathiness is a
characteristic of many female voices, but it is also common under certain
circumstances for male voices.<p>
The range of the br parameter is from 0 dB (no breathiness) to 70 dB (strong
breathiness). By experimenting, you can learn what intermediate values sound
like. For example, to turn Paul into a breathy, whispering speaker, use the
following command:<p>
<tt> [:np :dv br 55 gv 56] Do I sound more like Dennis now?</tt><p>
This voice is not as loud as the others because of the simultaneous
decrease in the gain of voicing, (gv), but it is intelligible and human sounding.
<p>
<b>Lax Breathiness, lx</b><p
The br parameter creates simultaneous breathiness whenever voicing is
turned on. Another type of breathiness occurs only at the ends of sentences and
when going from voiced to voiceless sounds. This type of "lax" breathiness is
controlled by the lx parameter in %.<p>
A nonbreathy, tense voice would have lx set to 0, while a maximally breathy,
lax voice would have lx set to 100. The difference between these two voices is
not great, but you can hear it if you listen closely.

<p>
<b>Smoothness, sm</b><p
Smoothness refers to vocal fold vibrations. The vocal folds meet at the
midline, as they do in normal voicing, but they do not slam together forcefully
to create a very sudden cessation of airflow.<p>
DECtalk Software uses a variable-cutoff, gradual low-pass filter to model
changes to smoothness. The range of sm is from 0 % (least smooth and most
brilliant) to 100 % (most smooth and least brilliant). The voicing source
spectrum is tilted so that energy at higher frequencies is attenuated by as
much as 30 dB when sm is set to the maximum but is not attenuated at all when
sm is set to 0.<p>
Professional singing voices that are trained to sing above an orchestra are
usually brilliant, while anyone who talks softly becomes breathy and smooth. To
synthesize a breathy voice, an sm value of about 50 or more is good. Changes to
sm do not have a great effect on perceived voice quality.

<p>
<b>Richness, ri</b><p
Richness is similar to smoothness and brilliance except that the
spectral change occurs at lower frequencies and is because of a different
physiological mechanism. Brilliant, rich voices carry well and are more
intelligible in noisy environments, while smooth, soft voices sound more
friendly. For example, the following command produces a soft, smooth version of
Paul's voice:<p>
<tt>	[:np :dv ri 0 sm 70] Do I sound more mellow?</tt><p>
The following command produces a maximally rich and brilliant (forceful) voice:
<p>
<tt>	[:np :dv ri 90 sm 0] Do I sound more forceful? </tt><p>
Smoothness and richness are usually negatively correlated when a
speaker dynamically changes laryngeal output. The sm and ri parameters do not
influence the speaker's identity very much.

<p>
<b>Nopen Fixed, nf</b><p>
The number of samples in the open part of the glottal cycle is
determined not only by ri, but also by a second parameter, nf. The nf parameter
is the number of fixed samples in the open portion of the glottal cycle.<p>
Most speakers adjust the open phase to be a certain fraction of the period, and
this fraction is determined by ri. Other speakers keep the open phase fixed in
duration when the overall period varies. To simulate this behavior, set ri to
100 and adjust nf to the desired duration of the open phase. The shortest
possible open phase is 10 (1 ms), and the longest is three quarters of the
period duration (about 70 for a male voice).

<p>
<b>Laryngealization, la</b><p
Many speakers turn voicing on and off irregularly at the beginnings and
ends of sentences, which gives a querulous tone to the voice. This departure
from perfect periodicity is called laryngealization or creaky voice quality.<p>
The la parameter controls the amount of laryngealization, in the voice. A value
of 0 results in no laryngealized irregularity, and a value of 100 (the maximum)
produces laryngealization at all times. For example, to make Betty moderately
laryngealized, type the following command:

<p>
<tt>[:nb :dv la 20]</tt><p>
The la parameter creates a noticeable difference in the voice,
although it is not altogether a pleasant change.

<A href="#Rtftoc1"><img align=bottom border=no src="yellowball.gif"></a>
<a name="RTFToC5"> Changing Pitch and Intonation</a> </h2>
Seven speaker-definition parameters control aspects of the fundamental
frequency (f0) contour of the voice. These parameters are as follows and are
described in the chapter on modifying voices.<p>
	bf	Baseline fall, in Hz<p>
	hr	Hat rise, in Hz<p>
	sr	Stress rise, in Hz<p>
	as	Assertiveness, in %<p>
	qu	Quickness, in %<p>
	ap	Average pitch, in Hz<p>
	pr	Pitch range, in %<p>
<p>
<b>Baseline Fall, bf</b><p>
The bf parameter in Hz determines one aspect of the dynamic fundamental
frequency contour for a sentence. If bf is 0, the reference baseline
fundamental frequency of a sentence begin and ends at 115 Hz. All rule-governed
dynamic swings in f0 are computed with respect to the reference baseline.<p>
Some speakers begin a sentence at a higher f0 and gradually fall as the
sentence progresses. This "falling baseline" behavior can be simulated by
setting bf to the desired fall in Hz. For example, setting bf to 20 Hz causes
the f0 pattern for a sentence to begin at 125 Hz (115 Hz plus half of bf) and
to fall at a rate of 16 Hz per second until it reaches 105 Hz (115 Hz minus
half of bf). The baseline remains at this lower value until it is reset
automatically before the beginning of the next full sentence (right after a
period, question mark, or exclamation point). The rate of fall (16 Hz per
second) is fixed, regardless of  the extent of the fall.<p>
Whenever you include a [+] phoneme in the text to indicate the beginning of a
paragraph, the baseline is automatically set to begin slightly higher for the
first sentence of the paragraph. While baseline fall differs among the
speakers, it is not a good cue for differentiating among them. As long as the
fall is not excessive, its presence or absence is hardly noticeable.

<p>
<b>Hat Rise, hr, and Stress Impulse Rise, sr</b><p>
The hr (nominal hat rises in Hz) and sr (nominal stress impulse rises in
Hz) parameters determine aspects of the dynamic fundamental frequency contour
for a sentence. To modify these values selectively, you should understand how
the f0 contour is computed as a function of lexical stress pattern and
syntactic structure of the sentence.<p>
A sentence is first analyzed and broken into clauses with punctuation and
clause-introducing words to determine the locations of clause boundaries.
Within each clause, the f0 contour rises on the first stressed syllable, stays
at a high level for the remainder of the clause up to the last stressed
syllable, and falls dramatically on the last stressed syllable. This
rise-at-the-beginning and fall-at-the-end pattern has been called the "hat
pattern" by linguists, using the analogy of jumping from the brim of a hat to
the top of the hat and back down again.<p>
The hr parameter indicates the nominal height, in Hz of a pitch rise to a
plateau on the first stress of a phrase. A corresponding pitch fall is placed
by rule on the last stress of the phrase. Some speakers use relatively large
hat rises and falls, while others use a local "impulse-like" rise and fall on
each stressed syllable. The default hr value for Paul is 22 Hz, indicating that
the f0 contour rises a nominal 22 Hz when going from the brim to the top of the
hat. To simulate a speaker who does not use hat rises and falls, use the
command:<p>
<tt>[:dv hr 0].</tt><p>
Other aspects of the hat pattern are important for natural intonation
but are not accessible by speaker-definition commands. For example, the hat
fall becomes a weaker fall followed by a slight continuation rise if the clause
is to be succeeded by more clauses in the same sentence. Also, if unstressed
syllables follow the last stressed syllable in a clause, part of the hat fall
occurs on the very last (unstressed) syllable of the clause. If the clause is
long, DECtalk Software may break it into two hat patterns by finding the
boundary between the noun phrase and the verb phrase.<p>
If DECtalk Software is in phoneme input mode and you use the pitch rise [/] and
pitch fall [\] symbols, the hr parameter determines the actual rise and fall in
Hz.
<p>
<b>Stress Rise, sr</b><p
The sr parameter indicates the nominal height, in Hz, of a local pitch
rise and fall on each stressed syllable. This rise-fall is added to any hat
rise or fall that is also present. For example, Paul has pr set to 32 Hz,
resulting in an f0 rise-fall gesture of 32 Hz over a span of about 150 ms,
which is located on the first and succeeding stressed syllables. However,
DECtalk Software rules reduce the actual height of successive stress rises and
falls in each clause and cause the last stress pulse to occur early so that
there is time for the hat fall during the vowel.<p>
If the sr parameter is set too low, the speech sounds monotone within long
phrases. Great changes to hr and sr from their default values for each speaker
are not necessary or desirable, except in unusual circumstances.

<p>
<b>Assertiveness, as</b><p>
Assertive voices have a dramatic fall in pitch at the end of utterances.
Neutral or meek speakers often end a sentence with a slight "questioning" rise
in pitch to deflect any challenges to their assertions. The as parameter, in %,
indicates the degree to which the voice tends to end statements with a
conclusive final fall. A value of 100 is very assertive, while a value of 0 is
extremely meek.

<p>
<b>Quickness, qu</b><p>
The qu parameter, in %, controls the speed of response to a request to
change the pitch. All hat rises, hat falls, and stress rises can be thought of
as suddenly applied commands to change the pitch, but the larynx is sluggish
and responds only gradually to each command. A smaller larynx typically
responds more quickly, so while Harry has a quickness value of 10, Kit has a
value of 50.<p>
In engineering terms, a value of 10 implies a time constant (time to get to 70
% of a suddenly applied step target) of about 100 ms. A value of 90 %
corresponds to a time constant of about 50 ms. Lower quickness values may mean
that the f0 never reaches the target value before a new command comes along to
change the target.

<p>
<b>Average Pitch, ap, and Pitch Range, pr</b><p>
The ap (average pitch, in Hz) and pr (pitch ranges in % of normal range)
parameters modify the computed values of fundamental frequency, f0, according
to the formula:<p>
<tt>f0' = ap + (((f0 - 120) * pr) / 100)</tt><p>
If ap is set to 120 Hz and pr to 100 %, there will be no change to the
"normal" f0 contour that is computed for a typical male voice. The effect of a
change in ap is simply to raise or lower the entire pitch contour independently
by a constant number of Hz, whereas the effect of pr is to expand or contract
the swings in pitch about 120 Hz.<p>
Normally, a smaller larynx simultaneously produces f0 values that are higher in
average pitch and higher in pitch range by about the same factor (the whole f0
contour is multiplied by a constant factor). Observing the values assigned to
ap and pr for each of the voices, you can see that the voices rank in average
pitch from low (Harry) to high (Kit). <p>
Rankings for pr are similar, except that Frank has a flat, nonexpressive pitch
range as compared with his average pitch.<p>
The best way to determine a good pitch range for a new voice is by trial and
error. You can create a monotone or robotlike voice by setting the pitch range
to 0. For example, to make Harry speak in a monotone at exactly 90 Hz, type the
following command.<p>
<tt> [:nh :dv ap 90 pr 0] I am a robot.</tt><p>
Reducing the pitch range reduces the dynamics of the voice, producing
emotions such as sadness in the speaker. Increasing the pitch range while
leaving the average pitch the same or setting it slightly higher suggests
excitement.<p>
Due to constraints involved in pitch-synchronous updating of other dynamically
changing parameters, the fundamental frequency contour that is computed by the
preceding formula is then checked for values that are outside the following
limits.<p>
<tt>f0 maximum = 500 Hz</tt><p>
<tt>f0 minimum = 50 Hz</tt><p>
Any value outside this range is limited to fall within the range.<p>
To keep you from exceeding reasonable limits on the parameters that control
pitch, certain constraints apply to the values selected. If a [:dv _] command
specifies values outside these limits, the value is limited to the nearest
listed value before execution.
<p>
<b>Changing Relative Gains and Avoiding Overloads</b><p>
Eight speaker-definition parameters control the output levels of various
internal resonators. These parameters are:<p>


<pre>
gv     Gain of voicing source, in dB                         
gh     Gain of aspiration source, in dB                      
gf     Gain of frication source, in dB                       
gn     Gain of nasalization, in dB                           
g1     Gain of cascade formant resonator 1, in dB            
g2     Gain of cascade formant resonator 2, in dB            
g3     Gain of cascade formant resonator 3, in dB            
g4     Gain of cascade formant resonator 4, in dB            
g5     Loudness of the voice, in dB                          

</pre>
<p>
<b>Loudness, g5</b><p>
Each predefined voice has been adjusted to have about the same perceived
loudness -- a value that is optimal for telephone conversation. The value
chosen is near maximum. (If loudness were increased much, some phonemes would
probably cause an overload squawk.) A near-maximum value was selected to
maximize the signal-to-noise level of DECtalk Software.<p>
If you want to decrease the loudness of a voice or temporarily increase  a
phrase that is known not to overload, determine the g5 value in dB for the
voice in question. Then adjust the voice by using the following command:<p>
<tt>[:np :dv g5 76] I am speaking at about half my normal level.</tt><p>
Because the g5 entry for Paul is 86, this command reduces loudness by
10 dB. Perceived loudness approximately doubles (or halves) for each 10 dB
increment (or decrement) in g5.<p>
Software control over loudness is useful in a loudspeaker application where the
background noise level in the room might change. For example, a vocally
handicapped, wheelchair-bound person does not want to appear to be shouting in
a quiet interpersonal conversation, but he or she may want to be able to
converse in a noisy room as well. Using a software abbreviation facility, such
a person could type "lo" to select a command making the voice maximally loud,
or "sof"  to invoke a command setting lo to a reduced value.<p>
<p>
<br>Note<br>DECtalk Software comes with volume control so that modification of
the g5 parameter should not be necessary. Using the [:volume ...] command or
the volume control knob on the external loudspeaker is recommended.

<p>
<b>Sound Source Gains, gv, gh, gf, and
gn</b><p>
Several types of sound sources are activated during speech production:
voicing, aspiration,  frication, and nasalization. The relative output levels
of these sounds, in dB, are determined by the gv, gh, gf and gn parameters,
respectively. The default settings for these parameters have been factory
preset to maximize the intelligibility of each voice. However, changing the
settings can be useful in debugging the system or in demonstrating aspects of
the acoustic theory of speech production. You can change the level of one sound
source globally, for example, turn off frication to be able to hear just the
output of the larynx. You might need to reduce these parameters to overcome
certain kinds of overloads, but try the procedure described in the next section
first.
<p>
<b>Cascade Vocal Tract Gains, g1, g2, g3, and
g4</b><p>
Changes in head size or other parameters can sometimes produce overloads
in the synthesizer circuits. If this occurs, make sure that f4 and f5 are set
to reasonable values. If the squawk remains, you can adjust several gain
controls -- g1 through g4, in dB -- in the cascade of formant resonators of the
synthesizer to attenuate the signal at critical points. These gains can then be
amplified back to desired output levels later in the synthesis.<p>
Use the following procedure to correct an overload (typically indicated by a
squawk during part of a word):<p>
Synthesize the word or phrase several times to make sure the squawk occurs
consistently. Use the same test word each time a change to a gain is made.<p>
Determine the default values for g1 through g4 for the speaker that
overloads.<p>
Reduce g1 by increments of 3 until the squawk goes away. When the squawk goes
away, note the reduction that was needed. If more than a 10 dB decrement is
required, some other parameter has probably been changed too much. If the
squawk does not go away at all, then you may need to reduce gv instead of g1.<p>
Increase g5 to return the output to its original level. For example, if g1 was
reduced by 6 dB, add 6 dB to lo (or to g4 if lo is already at a maximum). If
incrementing lo causes the squawk to return, then decrease lo slowly until the
squawk goes away.<p>
This procedure works in most cases, but using g2 rather than g1 can work
better. If you can return g1 to its factory-preset value and reduce g2 instead
to make the squawk go away, then the signal-to-quantization-noise level in g1
remains maximized. If you can eliminate the squawk by using g3 or g4 rather
than g2, more of the cascaded resonator system can be made immune to
quantization noise accumulation.
<p>
<b>The [save] Parameter and [:nv]
Voice</b><p>
You can save a modified speaker definition in a buffer while
synthesizing speech with one of the other voices. The Val voice [:nv] is either
male or female, depending on what values are stored in the buffer. If you call
Val before storing any values in the buffer, DECtalk Software uses the Perfect
Paul voice [:np]. The following commands store a modified Betty voice in Val
and then recall it.<p>
<tt>[:nb :dv sex m save ]</tt><p>
(Store the modified Betty voice in Val.)<p>
<tt>[:np] I am Paul.</tt><p>
(Use another voice.)<p>
<tt>[:nv] I am Val.</tt><p>
(Recall the Val [modified-Betty] voice.)<p>
The buffer holds its contents until you power down DECtalk Software. You must

<b>Summary on Speaker-Definition
Parameters</b><p>
Of the 27 parameters, only a few cause dramatic changes in the voice.
The greatest effects are obtained with changes to hs, ap, pr, and sx, while
moderate changes occur when modifying la and br. To some extent, DECtalk
Software's nine predefined speakers cover most of the possible voices, so don't
expect to be able to find a voice that is highly novel and intelligible.
However, you might easily find ways to improve one of the standard voices
slightly.
