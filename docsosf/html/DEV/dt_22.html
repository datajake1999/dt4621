The Text-To-Speech API is a Digital extension to the multimedia API specified
by the MME services for the Digital UNIX operating system. The API function set
gives you a flexible method of manipulating the various parameters of DECtalk
Software functionality from within your application. These functions perform a
wide range of tasks associated with the Text-To-Speech system and are listed by
functional category in Table 2-1.

<a name="RTFToC3">Using the Text-To-Speech API </a></h2>
This section describes how to write application programs using the DECtalk API.
The DECtalk Software API can be called from within any C program on the DIGITAL
UNIX  system. This API has been designed to be extensible for future Text-To-
Speech growth while still being easy to use. The current DECtalk Software
implementation supports only one instance of Text-To-Speech per process.
However, several copies of Text-To-Speech can simultaneously be run as separate
processes. However, several copies of the text-to-speech system can be run as
separate processes. 
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC4">Core API Functions </a></h3>
The core Text-To-Speech API functions are the following: <p>
<li>	TextToSpeechStartup() allocates system resources. <p>
<li>	TextToSpeechSpeak() queues text to the system. <p>
<li>	TextToSpeechShutdown() returns all system resources allocated by the
TextToSpeechStartup() function. <p>
  The simplest application might use only these functions. 
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC5">About the TextToSpeechSpeak() Function </a></h3>
The TextToSpeechSpeak() function is used to pass a null terminated string of
characters to the Text-To-Speech system. The system queues all characters up to
the null character. If the TTS_FORCE flag is not used in the call to the
TextToSpeechSpeak() function, then the queued characters are seamlessly
concatenated with previously queued characters. The TTS_FORCE flag is used to
force a string of characters to be spoken even though the string might not
complete a clause. For example: <p>
<tt>  TextToSpeechSpeak("This will be spoken. ", TTS_NORMAL ); </tt><p>
<p>
This text is spoken immediately by the system because it is terminated by a
period and a space. These last two characters are one way to create a clause
boundary. <p>
<tt>  TextToSpeechSpeak("This will be spok", TTS_NORMAL ); </tt><p>
<p>
This produces output only after the following line of code executes to complete
the phrase. <p>
<tt>  TextToSpeechSpeak("en. ", TTS_NORMAL ); </tt><p>
<p>
Finally, a nonphrase string can be forced to be spoken by using the TTS_FORCE
flag. <p>
<tt>   TextToSpeechSpeak("This will be spok", TTS_FORCE ); </tt><p>
<p>
Note that the word spoken is not pronounced correctly in this case even if the
final characters in the word spoken, (en), are queued immediately afterward. <p>
The TTS_FORCE flag causes the previous line to be spoken before taking any
subsequently queued characters into account. <p>
It is important that all sentences are separated with a space character. To
make sure of this, it is recommended that a space character is routinely
included after the final punctuation in a sentence. An example of what will
happen without this is shown below: <p>
<tt>  TextToSpeechSpeak("They are tired.", TTS_NORMAL );   TextToSpeechSpeak("I
am Cold.", TTS_NORMAL ); </tt><p>
<p>
Because there is no space, the Text-To-Speech system processes the following
string: <p>
<tt>  "They are tired.I am Cold." </tt><p>
<p>
The string "tired.I" will be pronounced incorrectly because the
system will treat it as one item instead of two words. 
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC6">Audio Output Control Functions </a></h3>
An application can control speech output using the TextToSpeechPause()
function, the TextToSpeechResume() function, and the TextToSpeechReset()
function. These functions pause the audio output, resume output after pausing,
and reset the Text-To-Speech system. A reset discards all queued text, and
stops and discards all queued audio. If the application has called the
TextToSpeechOpenInMemory() function to store speech samples in memory, a reset
causes all buffers to be returned to the application. 
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC7">Blocking Synchronization Function </a></h3>
  A special function called TextToSpeechSync() is provided to block until all
text previously queued by the TextToSpeechSpeak() function is spoken. Once this
function is called, there is no way to abort until all text is processed. This
could take hours if there is sufficient text queued. Nonblocking
synchronization can be provided using the index mark command. See the Runtime
User's Guide for more information on the index mark command.

<a name="RTFToC9"> Special Text-To-Speech Modes</a></h2>
After the TextToSpeechStartup()  function is called by an application, it can
then call the TextToSpeechSpeak()  function to speak text. The application can
also use the Text-To-Speech API to select different modes.These modes allow for
writing wave files; writing a log file, which can contain text, phonemes, or
syllables; or writing the audio (speech) samples to memory. Each mode-switch
function has a corresponding function to return the Text-To-Speech system to
the startup state. These functions are listed below.<p>


<table width=100% border=1>
<th>Open <th>Close                                   <tr>

<p>
The Text-To-Speech system must be in the startup state before calling any of
the Open functions listed above. The corresponding Close functions return the
system to the startup state.

<a name="RTFToC10"> Loading and Unloading a User Dictionary </a></h2>
 The TextToSpeechLoadUserDictionary() function is used to load a user
dictionary created with the userdic program. The TextToSpeechUnloadDictionary()
function is used to unload a user dictionary. 
<hr noshade size=1><h2>
<a href="DtkDevGuide.html"><img align=bottom border=no src="redball.gif"></a>
<a name="RTFToC11"> Creating a Wave File </a></h2>
 After calling the TextToSpeechStartup() function, an ap- plication can call
the function TextToSpeechOpenWaveOutFile(). This function blocks until all
previously queued text has been processed. After the function returns, all text
subsequently queued by the function TextToSpeechSpeak() is converted to speech
and written into a wave file. Function TextToSpeechCloseWaveOutFile() blocks
until the speech from all previously queued text is written to the file. 
<hr noshade size=1><h2>
<a href="DtkDevGuide.html"><img align=bottom border=no src="redball.gif"></a>
<a name="RTFToC12"> Creating a Log File </a></h2>
After calling the TextToSpeechStartup() function, an application can call the
TextToSpeechOpenLogFile() function. This function blocks until all previously
queued text has been processed. After the function returns, all text
subsequently queued by the TextToSpeechSpeak() function is written to a log
file as either text, phonemes, or syllables. The phonemes and syllables are
written using the arpabet phoneme alphabet. The TextToSpeechCloseLogFile()
function terminates phoneme logging and blocks until the speech from all
previously queued text is processed. 
<hr noshade size=1><h2>
<a href="DtkDevGuide.html"><img align=bottom border=no src="redball.gif"></a>
<a name="RTFToC13"> Storing Speech Samples in Memory </a></h2>
 To cause all speech samples to be put in memory, the application must call the
TextToSpeechOpenInMemory() function. This function blocks until all previously
queued text has been processed. The memory buffers to store the speech samples
are supplied to the Text-To-Speech system by the TextToSpeechAddBuffer()
function. This function is used to pass a pointer to a structure of type
TTS_BUFFER_ T. (The TTS_BUFFER_T structure is defined in the include file
ttsapi.h.) <p>
   When a buffer is completed, the buffer is returned to the application by
sending a message to the callback function that corresponds to the callback
function passed to the TextToSpeechStartup() function. A pointer to the
returned TTS_BUFFER_T structure is contained in the LPARAM parameter of the
message. The user is responsible for the allocation and freeing of memory for
the following elements in the TTS_BUFFER_T structure: lpData, lpPhoneme array,
and lpIndex array. <p>
   The TTS_BUFFER_T structure is considered completed when any one of the
following conditions occurs: <p>
   o  The sample buffer, which is pointed to by element lpData, is filled. <p>
   o  The phoneme array is filled. <p>
   o  The index mark array is filled. <p>
   o  A TTS_FORCE is used in a call to the TextToSpeechSpeak() function. <p>
The application must not modify any buffer passed to the Text- To-Speech system
by function TextToSpeechAddBuffer() until the buffer is returned from the
Text-To-Speech system in a message. The application then owns the buffer. If no
buffers are available, the system blocks. If the application is processing
relatively long passages of text, it is recommended that the application queue
several buffers and then requeue each buffer after finishing with it so that
the system is never idle. <p>
A call to the TextToSpeechReset() function returns all buffers to the
application. The TextToSpeechReturnBuffer() function is supplied to force the
return of the current TTS_BUFFER_T structure, whether it is filled or not. This
function might not be required by most applications. It is included so that an
application can obtain the last buffer without forcing that buffer to be sent
with the TTS_FORCE command in the TextToSpeechSpeak() function. This might be
required, if the application performs its own buffer management. <p>
  The TTS_BUFFER_T structure and its elements are defined as follows: <p>
<pre>
<tt>  typedef struct TTS_PHONEME_TAG {  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwPhoneme;  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwPhonemeSampleNumber;  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwPhonemeDuration;  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwReserved; </tt>
<tt>  } TTS_PHONEME_T;</tt>
<p>
<tt>  typedef TTS_PHONEME_T * LPTTS_PHONEME_T; </tt><br>
<p>
<tt>  typedef struct TTS_INDEX_TAG {  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwIndexValue;  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwIndexSampleNumber;  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwReserved; </tt>
<tt>  } TTS_INDEX_T; </tt>
<p>
<tt>  typedef TTS_INDEX_T * LPTTS_INDEX_T; </tt><p>
<tt>  typedef struct TTS_BUFFER_TAG {  </tt>
<tt>	LPSTR lpData;  </tt>
<tt>	LPTTS_PHONEME_T lpPhonemeArray;  </tt>
<tt>	LPTTS_INDEX_T lpIndexArray;  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwMaximumBufferLength;  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwMaximumNumberOfPhonemeChanges;  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwMaximumNumberOfIndexMarks;  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwBufferLength;  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwNumberOfPhonemeChanges;  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwNumberOfIndexMarks;  </tt>
<tt>	DWORD dwReserved; </tt>
<tt>   } TTS_BUFFER_T; </tt><p>
<tt>   typedef TTS_BUFFER_T * LPTTS_BUFFER_T; </tt><p>
</pre>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC14">TTS_BUFFER_T Structure Initialization </a></h3>
The TTS_BUFFER_T structure and the elements of its lpData, lpPhonemeArray, and
lpIndexArray members point to must be allocated and freed by the user. (Note
that the last two pointers can be optionally set to NULL if they are not used
by the application.) <p>
<li>	The lpData element points to a byte array. The dwMaximumBufferLength
must be set to the length of this array. <p>
<li>	If the lpPhonemeArray element is set to NULL, then no phonemes are
returned. Otherwise, the lpPhonemeArray element must point to an application-
allocated array of structures of type TTS_PHONEME_ T. The length of this array
must be copied into the dwMaximumNumberOfPhonemeChanges element. <p>
<li>	If the lpIndexArray element is set to NULL, then no index marks are
returned. Otherwise, the lpIndexArray element must point to an
application-allocated array of structures of type TTS_INDEX_T. The length of
this ar- ray must be copied into the dwMaximumNumberOfIndexMarks element. 
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC15">TTS_BUFFER_T Return Values </a></h3>
When the TTS_BUFFER_T structure is returned to the application, it contains the
following return values: <p>
<li>	The number of bytes of audio samples pointed to by the lpData element
are returned in the dwBufferLength element. <p>
<li>	The number of phoneme changes contained in the array pointed to by the
lpPhonemeArray element are returned in the dwNumberOfPhonemeChanges element. <p>
<li>	The number of index marks contained in the array pointed to by the
lpIndexArray are returned in the dwNumberOfIndexMarks element. <p>
The index and phoneme arrays each contain a time stamp in the form of a sample
number. This sample number is initialized at zero at startup and after each
call to the TextToSpeechReset() function. The phoneme array also contains the
current phoneme duration in frames. Each frame is approximately 6.4
milliseconds. <p>
