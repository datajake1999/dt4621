<a name="RTFToC2"> Sample Programs </a></h2>
Some applications are included with DECtalk Software. These sample applications
have been included to demonstrate the use of DECtalk Software APIs. These
sources can be used as templates for other applications that you might want to
develop. Sources to these programs can be found in: <p>
   /usr/examples/dtk/dtsamples <p>
   The samples and a brief description are listed below. <p>
<ul>
<li>xmsay.c and  xmsay and its companion uil file xmsay.uil demonstrate the
use of DECtalk Software APIs in the Motif windows environment. <p>
<li>say.c  This is a command line program that    speaks out the text typed
on the command line. <p>
<li>mailtalk.c -- mailtalk announces the arrival of mail when new mail is
received. The file mailtalk.ini in /usr/lib/dtk/ contains default announcement
messages that mailtalk uses. To have mailtalk speak your own custom messages
copy the mailtalk.ini file into your login directory and edit the strings. <p>
<li>aclock.c -- Announces the time at specified intervals. <p>
<li>dtmemory.c -- In dtmemory DECtalk Software passes back synthesized
speech in buffers. These buffers are written out into a wave file. 
</ul>

<a name="RTFToC3">Building the Sample Programs </a></h2>
Sample programs can be created from the sources provided in
/usr/examples/dtk/dtsamples. This section describes the procedure for building
the sample programs. Before proceeding make sure that the DECtalk Software
development kit has been installed. See the DECtalk Software Users Guide for
more information on different components of DECtalk Software. <p>
<ol>
<li>Create a local directory that you want to build he sample programs in.  <p>
<li>Copy all the files in /usr/examples/dtk/dtsamples into the directory that
you just created. <p>
<li>Generate a Makefile from the Imakefile by typing:<p>
<tt>/usr/bin/X11/xmkmf</tt><p>
<p>
<li>Compile and link the sample application programs by typing  the
following while still in the directory that you just created: <p>
<tt> make all </tt><p>
<li>After the make program completes successfully, the sample programs
are ready to run.<p>
</ol>
In addition to the sample programs you will also find some demo text files in
your directory.  These files demonstrate some of the DECtalk Software
capabilities.

<a name="RTFToC4">Programming</a></h3>
This section describes the DECtalk API programming environment. Topics include:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Header files <p>
<li>Shareable libraries <p>
<li>Compiling and linking applications
</ol>
<h3> <a name="RTFToC5">Header Files </a></h3>
DECtalk provides three header files that contain all the public data-structure
definitions that the DECtalk Software API references. They are ttsapi.h,
dtmmedefs.h, and engphon.h. When DECtalk Software is installed, these files are
in /usr/include/dtk. <p>
<ul>
<li> <b>ttsapi.h</b> contains definitions of constants used in the DECtalk
Software API calls, data structures that define the buffers that DECtalk
Software returns, and the API function prototype definitions. <p>
<li><b>dtmmedefs.h</b> contains the basic data structure definitions used by
DECtalk Software. It also contains definitions of error codes and audio
formats. This file enables you to compile, link, and run certain DECtalk
programs even if Multimedia Services for DIGITAL UNIX  is not installed.
Specifically, if you are writing an application program that does not use the
audio drivers but want to use DECtalk Software to produce synthesized speech
buffers (via the TextToSpeechInMemory calls), then using dtmmedefs.h
circumvents the requirement for Multimedia Services for DIGITAL UNIX . <p>
<li><b>engphon.h</b> contains a list of American English Phoneme Codes. 
</ul>

<h3><a name="RTFToC6">Shareable Libraries </a></h3>
DECtalk Software APIs are available to programmers in two shareable libraries.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>libtts.so</b> contains device independent DECtalk Software routines.<p>
<li><b>libttsmme.so</b> contains the DECtalk Software library that requires
Multimedia Services for DIGITAL UNIX . <p>
</ul>
As in the case of the header files, if you want to use DECtalk Software to
write an application that produces buffers of synthesized speech, then the
program is linked with libtts.so. If, on the other hand, you want to use the
Multimedia Services for DIGITAL UNIX  to communicate with the audio subsystem
then the application has to be linked with libttsmme.so.
