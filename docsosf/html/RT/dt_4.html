DECtalk Software</a></a> uses stress and syntactic symbols to control aspects
of rhythm, stress, and intonation patterns within a spoken text file. These
symbols include punctuation marks such as commas, periods, and open and close
parentheses. Punctuation marks are recognized by DECtalk Software as indicating
special phrasing requirements.  Table 4-1 and Table 4-2 list these symbols.

Speaking Rate</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
The default speaking rate is 180 words per minute. DECtalk Software speaking
rates now range from 75 to 600 WPM. Speaking rates can beadjusted to be very
slow, very fast, or anywhere in between by using the following commands:<p>
Valid speaking rates are between 75 and 600 in the [:ra ] command. Rates
specified outside this range are limited to the nearest legal value.<p>
<b>[:ra 120]</b> 	Although the slowest possible rate is 75 wpm, 120 wpm is
ideal for situations where material such as a phone number has to be copied
down by a listener. Note that it might be frustrating to listen to extended
speech at slow rates unless the listener is actually copying down each
numeral.<p>
<b>[:ra 160]</b>	This rate is moderate [160 wpm]. It sounds a little slow, but
is sometimes preferred in certain examples. For example, when DECtalk Software
is speaking math equations or long lists of acronyms.<p>
<b>[:ra 180]</b>	This rate is the default rate for DECtalk Software (180 wpm).
It is ideal for listening to continuous text under optimal conditions.<p>
<b>[:ra 240]</b>	This rate is faster, (240 wpm). Practiced listeners might
prefer to skim material at this rate. Inexperienced listeners might not
understand every word at this rate.<p>
<b>[:ra 350]</b>	This rate is very fast, (350 wpm). In fact, it is too fast to
follow, but it does have applications in special circumstances where an
individual needs to scan sections of text quickly.<p>
<b>[:ra 550]</b>	This rate is the fastest usable<i> </i>rate. It is too fast
for many people to follow, but it does have applications for individuals who
want to scan text very quickly. <p>
Changes in the speaking rate influence the duration and the number of pauses in
text, as well as the duration of individual phonemes. At rates below 140 wpm,
DECtalk Software inserts pauses at all phrase boundaries and pauses, and
inserts phonemes near the ends of phrases. At rates faster than 240 wpm,
DECtalk Software deletes all pauses and shortens phonemes. (Near the beginning
of phrases, phonemes are fairly short at both slow and fast speaking rates.)

Adjusting Period and Comma Pause
Durations</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
At the default speaking rate (180 wpm), DECtalk Software pauses about half a
second after a period in the text and about a sixth of a second after a comma.
However, pause durations are adjusted automatically when you change the
speaking rate.<p>
In some situations, you might prefer a pause after a period without changing
the speaking rate. For example, to get DECtalk Software to read a list of words
at a normal rate with five-second pauses after each word (to allow the listener
to write them down), you can use one of the following commands and end each
word with a comma or a period:<p>
<b>[:pp 4500]</b>	Adds a period pause of 4500 ms (4.5 seconds) to the standard
half-second pause that occurs after a period in text. The total pause between
words is about five seconds. The accepted range for a period pause is from -380
to 30000 ms. A negative value shortens the standard period pause.<p>
<b>[:cp 4800]</b>	Adds a comma pause of 4800 ms (4.8 seconds) to the standard
sixth of a second pause that occurs after a comma in the text at normal
speaking rate. The total pause between words separated by a comma is about five
seconds. The accepted range for a comma pause is from -40 to 30000 ms. Values
specified outside this range are limited to the nearest legal value.<p>
<b>[:pp 0 :cp 0]</b>	Resets the period pause and comma pause to their normal
default values.

Even though DECtalk Software allows for natural text-to-speech synthesis, the
quality of speech can often be enhanced by giving it a more natural flow. Much
of this tuning involves the strategic placement of commas and periods, which
tell the application to pause, as a native speaker of English does when
speaking. The spoken language and written text are different as spoken text
generally does not contain information about pausing.</a>

Developing an Advanced Speech
Application</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
The development process described in this guide assumes that your application
has full control of the text being spoken. However, if you are developing an
application that reads arbitrary text (such as electronic mail messages), your
task is more difficult because almost anything can appear in the text. You can
put application-specific text filters in the controlling computer, rather than
add many additional special cases (and switches to enable and disable them) to
DECtalk Software.<p>
<a name="_Toc298541498"><a name="_Toc304344625"><a name="_Toc304675961"><a name="_Toc307361413"><a name="_Toc307876456"><a name="_Toc307882984"><a name="_Toc307894760"><a name="_Toc307897373"><a name="_Toc307897649"><a name="_Toc308407459"><a name="_Toc309539445"><a name="_Toc326653732"><a name="_Toc347636742"><a name="_Toc349699155"><a name="_Toc349703810">

<a name="Rtftoc9">
Developing an Electronic Mail-Reading
Application</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
You can write an electronic mail preprocessor to make the following text
conversions before sending the text to DECtalk Software:<p>
<li>	Parse the header boiler plate to remove extraneous information.<p>
<li>	Add the new paragraph symbol [+] to each blank line between paragraphs
if DECtalk Software is speaking paragraphs of text.<p>
<li>	Create your own application-specific dictionary for words, such as
proper names, that DECtalk Software mispronounces. If DECtalk Software is
connected to a database containing names, consider adding a pronunciation field
to the name record or entering phonemic text when appropriate. (DECtalk
Software can handle many proper names and addresses using the [:pronounce name]
or [:mode name ] commands.) <p>
<li>	Scan the text for strings of numbers in a format understandable to your
application but not to DECtalk Software. For example, if you can extract the
time format from an electronic mail message, you can add code to your
application to expand it to its "o'clock" form.<p>
<li>	In many applications, the listener might want to write down number
strings (such as prices or telephone numbers). Your application can scan the
text for strings of numbers and, when found, send them to DECtalk Software in
such a way that includes pauses at critical locations. <p>
      For example:<p>
<tt>The number is, 1 (800) 5 5 5, 1 2 3 4. [:ra 120]</tt><p>
<tt>That is, [_&lt;300&gt;] 1 (800), [_&lt;500&gt;] 5 5 5, </tt><p>
<tt>[_&lt;900&gt;] 1 2 3 4. [:ra 180].</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
The spaces between the numbers ensure that "five five five" is spoken rather
than "five hundred fifty five." (You can also use the [:mode spell on] command.
The slower speaking rate, <tt>[:ra 120],</tt> and the silence phonemes,
<tt>[_&lt;300&gt;], [_&lt;500&gt;], [_&lt;900&gt;]</tt>, of specified
durations, were carefully selected to allow enough time for the listener to
write down the entire number. Silence phonemes were positioned after the commas
(<tt>that is,</tt> <tt>[_&lt;300&gt;] 1 (800), [_&lt;500&gt;])</tt>, to
maintain appropriate intonation.<p>
As another example, if your application is required to speak sums of money
(such as bank balances or item costs), you might code the text to say:<p>
<tt>Your balance is $244.05. That is, 2 4 4, [_&lt;400&gt;] point 0 5,
[_&lt;400&gt;] dollars.</tt><p>
<tt></tt>	When spelling an item out, your application might need to distinguish
the case of letters. Consider using different voices to distinguish between
uppercase and lowercase letters. For example:<p>
<tt>[:nf]Maynard [:nf]M[:nb]a y n a r d [:nf]Maynard.

Optimizing the Quality of Spoken
Text</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
In some applications, it might be important to get a few sentences to sound
natural and pleasing to the listener because they hear them more often.
Therefore, you might want to improve the quality of a particular sentence. The
following steps are suggested:<p>
1.	Send the sentence to DECtalk Software and listen to it a number of times,
focusing on each word to detect any mispronunciations.<p>
2.	Change text to phonemic text for all mispronounced words. <p>
Note<br>For words that have two pronunciations (homographs), see online help or Appendix B.<p>
<p>
DECtalk Software can choose the correct pronunciation by itself. For example,
if you enter the following sentences:<p>
<tt>He produced a lot of <i>REFUSE</i>. He <i>REFUSE</i>d the produce.</tt><p>
<tt>He <i>INSERTS</i> 5 <i>INSERTS</i> per minute. He <i>DELIBERATE</i>d
<i>DELIBERATE</i>ly for a long time.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>You can see how some of these words could be pronounced incorrectly.
You can correct such mispronunciation by doing one of the following:<p>
  Replace the correct spelling of the word with a clever misspelling.<p>
<tt>I red yesterday that . . .</tt><p>
<tt></tt>  Spell the word phonetically <p>
<tt>I [r'ehd] yesterday that . . .</tt><p>
<tt></tt>Additionally, use the following steps to optimize spoken text.<p>
1.	If the word is a compound, use a hyphenated spelling to help DECtalk
Software see the two parts of the compound.<p>
<tt>The slide-show host . . .</tt><p>
<tt></tt>2.	Replace the text version by a phonemic string. Use the commands and
phonemic symbols, but make sure to place the lexical stress pattern
correctly.<p>
Note<br>Sometimes, a word does not sound quite right even when the best
phonemic representation is selected. Usually, such subtle pronunciation defects
are not correctable.<p>
3.	Now that each word has been pronounced in the best possible way, listen to
the total sentence rhythm and accent pattern. If it is not right, follow these
steps.<p>
(a)	If it sounds like there should be a short pause in a particular sentence
location, but DECtalk Software says the sentence without a pause, insert a
comma between the words in question.<p>
(b)	If the wrong word is emphasized in the sentence, emphasize the word that is
suppose to take the emphasis with the correct stress symbols . <p>
<tt>The ["] younger man is the trouble-maker, not the older one.</tt><p>
<tt></tt>(c)	Use the pitch control symbols slash [/], backslash [\], and slash
and backslash <br>[/ \] to make final adjustments.<p>
(d)	If none of these actions gives you a satisfactory sentence, you can still
specify duration and fundamental frequency motions for all phonemes with the
voice-control commands discussed fully in Chapter 5.

Avoiding Common
Errors</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
When using DECtalk Software, try to avoid making two common errors by doing the
following:<p>
<li>	When making voice-selection changes, always return to the default voice
you have chosen.<p>
If you forget to return DECtalk Software to the default voice after using one
of the other voices, all future text uses the currently selected voice.<p>
<li>	Enter a right bracket ( ] ) at the beginning of your text.<p>
If the [:phoneme arpabet speak] command is entered allowing phonemic input, it
is possible for DECtalk Software to enter phonemic mode unintentionally if the
text being spoken contains an unexpected left bracket ( [ ), or if you forget
to enter a right ( ] ) bracket after a phonemic entry. DECtalk Software is left
in a state where it will interpret all remaining text phonemically. For
example:<p>
<tt>] [:phone on] [:ra 220 [:nh] Ladies and Gentlemen </tt><p>
<tt>			  ^ (right bracket ( ] ) is missing</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
</body></html>
