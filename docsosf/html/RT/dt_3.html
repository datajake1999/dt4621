Started <img src=rainbowl.gif></a>
</a></h1>

This chapter provides an introduction to basic voice and program control
operations. It gives you step-by-step instructions on how to perform each
operation. Basic operations are explained from the perspective of the
application user. That approach gives you a feel for using DECtalk Software
whether you are using the sample program or inserting commands on the Digital
UNIX command line. <p>

<b>	Inserting Voice-Control Commands (Syntax
Rules)</a></a></a></a></a></b><b></b><p>
Before you can use DECtalk Software commands to modify speech output, you need
to know the proper syntax with which to include those commands into a text
file. Figure 3-2 illustrates the rules of DECtalk Software command syntax.

    Enclose every command in brackets.                         
    Begin every command with a colon.                          
    Separate each command and its parameter or parameters      
    from the text by a valid word boundary marker, such as a   
    space, tab, or carriage return. A space is used here.      
    You can include several commands within the same           
    brackets.                                                  
    Include several parameters within the same brackets if     
    the command allows more than one parameter. If you use     
    several parameters, enter each command's parameters        
    before you enter a second command in the same bracket.     
    (In this example, the parameter group modifies the [:dv]   
    command.)                                                  
    If you give two conflicting parameters or commands         
    Rhythm:control ofSyllabic stress:control ofDECtalk         
    Software uses the last command in the sequence. (In this   
    example, Rhythm:control ofSyllabic stress:control          
    ofDECtalk Software uses Paul's voice.)                     
    You can use phonemic symbols within the same brackets      
    with voice commands. In this example, the phonetic         
    spelling of word really (r"iyliy) is included.             
<a name="_Toc308407438"><a name="_Toc309539424"><a name="_Toc326653711"><a name="_Toc349699140"><a name="_Toc349703794">

<a name="Rtftoc4">Additional
Syntax Rules</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
If the value in a [:dv] command is too low, DECtalk Software<b> </b>uses the
minimum valid value. If the value is too high, it uses the maximum valid
value.<p>
Once you enter a command, that command applies to the remaining text until it
is overridden by another command. For example, the command [:nk] invokes Kit's
voice on all entered text until you enter another voice-selection command.<p>
Invalid commands are ignored. By setting the [:error speak] command, you can
receive an <i>audible</i> warning that an invalid command has been entered.<p>
DECtalk Software interprets text between brackets as phonemes only after the
[:phoneme arpabet speak on]<i> </i>command has been sent to the application. If
[:phoneme arpabet speak on] has not been sent DECtalk Software interprets the
brackets and characters between them literally. The [:phoneme arpabet speak
off] command must be sent with literal characters if you want to insert
brackets in normal text.<p>
If the command [:phoneme arpabet speak on]<i> </i>is set and you forget the
right bracket ( ] ), DECtalk Software<b> </b>attempts to interpret all text
following the ASCII text as phonemes, skipping over illegal letter
combinations. The resulting text sounds garbled. Enter a right bracket to fix
this problem.</a><p>

Changing Voice Selections</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
You can change a speaking voice by inserting DECtalk Software commands into the
text-collection area displayed in the speak applet window <i>or</i> by
selecting text and then clicking on one of the nine picture buttons at the top
of the speak window. <p>
Voice changes made with commands are permanent for the session and remain
intact as along as the command remains in the file. Voice changes made from the
menu only remain in effect as long as the current <b> </b>DECtalk Software<b>
</b>session is running.<p>
Each voice selection is inserted into the command [:n <i>x</i>] where <i>x</i>
is a value representing one of the voices. Table 3-2 -- Changing Voices, lists
the names and their corresponding values. <p>
You can change voices with a new voice command as in the following example.<p>
<tt>[:nb] Hello. I'm Betty.</tt><p>
<tt></tt>You can also change voices in the middle of a sentence.<p>
<tt>[:np] This is a demo [:nb] of a sudden change in voice.</tt><p>
<tt></tt>If a voice-change request occurs in the middle of a sentence, DECtalk
Software automatically pauses. The pause is the equivalent of inserting a
comma, or about half a second.<p>
<tt>[:np] This is a demo, [:nb] of a sudden change in voice.</tt><p>

Building a User Dictionary</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Building a user dictionary is a two-step process. First you create a .tab
source file with the User Dictionary Build Tool to define the pronunciation of
special words you want to place in the dictionary. Then you compile the .tab
file to produce a .dic file. This file is loaded into a DECtalk Software
session through the Speak applet or an API call.

Running mailtalk</a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
The mailtalk program applet is included with DECtalk Software and announces the
arrival of mail messages as they are delivered to your system. Depending on the
options you select, mailtalk announces the sender of the message, its subject,
or both. 
<a name="_Toc347636733"><a name="_Toc349699146"><a name="_Toc349703800">

<a name="Rtftoc10">Mailtalk.ini
File</a></a></a> 
</a></h3>
The installation procedure places the default mailtalk.ini file in the
directory /usr/lib/dtk/. The .ini file contains the boilerplate text that is
spoken by mailtalk. You may modify this and place it in your login directory.
mailtalk first looks in your login directory for a mailtalk.ini file; if it
does not find one then it uses the default mailtalk.ini file in /usr/lib/dtk/.
<p>
Standard DECtalk Software voice-control commands can be embedded in the text
strings to control attributes, such as speaking voice and speaking speed. See
Chapter 4 for information about DECtalk Software in-line commands. The maximum
length of any string is 256 characters. Characters beyond 256 are truncated.
The format for the ini file is as follows: <p>
<tt> [mailtalk] </tt><p>
<tt>INCOMING = You have just received a mail message  </tt><p>
<tt>UNREAD  = You have unread mail messages </tt><p>
<tt>FROM   = from </tt><p>
<tt>SUBJECT = In regards to </tt><p>
<tt>INIT   = [:np :ra 180] </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Upon receving an incomming mail message mailtalk will first speak out
the INCOMING mesage, in this case it will say - "You have just received a mail
message". mailtalk will then announce the FROM and finally the SUBJECT fields.
The DECtalk Software in-line commands in INIT set up the mailtalk, in this
case, to use Paul's voice at a rate of 180 words per minute. <p>
