<a name="Rtftoc2">Overview</a></a>
 
</a></h3>

DECtalk Software extends the capabilities of your workstation by turning text
files into spoken words. It can accurately read ASCII text from a variety of
sources, such as electronic mail and word processors, using a standard audio
device for output. Nine different voices are provided and users can control
voice pitch, rate of speech, and word or phrase emphasis.

DECtalk Software Features</a></a>  
</a></h2>
DECtalk Software provides the following features: 
<a name="_Toc349699114"><a name="_Toc349703767">
<hr noshade size=1><h3><a href="DtkUsersGuide.html"><img align=bottom border=no src="redball.gif""></a>
<a name="Rtftoc4">Latest
Version of Digital Speech Synthesis Technology</a></a>  
</a></h3>
DECtalk Software contains the latest version of DECtalk Software speech
synthesis. This incorporates a number of improvements from earlier versions of
DECtalk Software and is a software-only version of DECtalk Software offered by
Digital. 
<a name="_Toc349699115"><a name="_Toc349703768">
<hr noshade size=1><h3><a href="DtkUsersGuide.html"><img align=bottom border=no src="redball.gif""></a>
<a name="Rtftoc5">Letter
Mode, Word Mode, and Clause Mode</a></a>   
</a></h3>
DECtalk Software can immediately speak single characters without waiting for an
entire clause to be buffered. This feature is useful in applications requiring
tactile feedback for what was entered on the keyboard. It also provides normal
clause buffering for natural speech. DECtalk Software can speak letters, words,
phrases, clauses, paragraphs, and whole documents. DECtalk Software allows the
application to terminate speech immediately instead of waiting for the buffered
text to complete processing.

<hr noshade size=1><h3><a href="DtkUsersGuide.html"><img align=bottom border=no src="redball.gif""></a>
<a name="Rtftoc6">Short
Command Strings</a></a>   
</a></h3>
Many of the command strings, such as change rate, change voice, start, stop,
and index marks can be abbreviated for greater ease of use in applications. 
<a name="_Toc349699117"><a name="_Toc349703770">
<hr noshade size=1><h3><a href="DtkUsersGuide.html"><img align=bottom border=no src="redball.gif""></a>
<a name="Rtftoc7">High-Quality
Speech and Word Pronunciation</a></a>   
</a></h3>
DECtalk Software speech retains its high quality. In addition, a number of
improvements have been made in functionality and acoustic phonetic quality. <p>
The accuracy of word pronunciation is higher than in any previous version of
DECtalk Software. There have been significant improvements in the accuracy and
quality of letter-to-phoneme rules. Also, DECtalk Software has a large built-in
dictionary that is used in the accurate pronunciation of individual words as
well as enhancing their rhythmic naturalness.

<hr noshade size=1><h3><a href="DtkUsersGuide.html"><img align=bottom border=no src="redball.gif""></a>
<a name="Rtftoc8">Pronunciation
Heuristics</a></a>   
</a></h3>
Certain heuristics have been improved and made more intelligent. For example,
DECtalk Software is able to recognize and parse unpronounceable sequences such
as uppercase initials (FBI, AAA, and so forth) in addition to the normal
unpronounceable sequences such as those with no vowels (CBS or NBC, for
example).

<a name="Rtftoc9">DECtalk
Software API</a></a>  
</a></h3>
The Text-To-Speech API is the Digital extension to Multimedia Services for
Digital UNIX.  You can use this API to write your own applications. You will
need the DECtalk Software Development kit in order to access the APIs.<p>
The API function set gives you a flexible method of manipulating DECtalk
Software functionality from within your application. These functions perform a
wide range of tasks associated with the Text-To-Speech system. See DECtalk
Software Programmer's Reference Guide (QA-228AA-WZ.4.2A) for a complete list of
API functions.

<a name="Rtftoc10">Voice-Control
Commands</a></a>   
</a></h3>
DECtalk Software programming aids include Voice-Control
    commands, also called inline commands. These commands can be used to
perform simple voice-control operations, such as changing the speaking rate or
speaking voice while DECtalk Software is speaking, or more complex operations,
such as modifying the characteristics of each voice, controlling intonation and
stress within written text, or creating special effects such as singing.
Commands are inserted into ASCII text files displayed in one of the program
applets or directly into the application sources through the API functions. <p>
Commands have special syntax rules and components that you need to use when you
insert them into files.

<a name="Rtftoc11">DECtalk
Software Dictionaries</a></a>    
</a></h3>
DECtalk Software has two pronunciation dictionaries: a large internal
(built-in) dictionary and an optional user-defined dictionary. With the large
built-in dictionary, developers can easily use many proper names and normally
unpronounceable sequences, such as uppercase initials, in their applications.
With the user dictionary build tool, developers can load application-specific
words, or cultural- or language-specific terms into the user dictionary. A
sample user-dictionary file is installed with the software.

<a name="Rtftoc20">DECface</a></a>
 
</a></h3>
DECface is a computer-generated, synthetic face that synchronizes facial
movements to synthesized speech provided by DECtalk. As DECtalk generates
speech, DECface displays the facial expressions of a human actually speaking
those words. <p>
 DECface offers the ability to develop a large variety of new applications by
combining the audio functionality of a speech synthesizer with the graphical
functionality of a computer-generated face.   A synthetic character can give
multimedia presentations, or monitor a system and report anomalies as a
feedback agent.<p>
DECface enhances DECtalk by providing an obvious and immediate visual feedback
mechanism. In particular, multimedia projects involving direct user interaction
can be enhanced to better attract and maintain the attention of viewers.
<p>
Specific information on how to invoke and use DECface can be found in the
documents located in: <p>

the Application User</a></a>  
</a></h3>
The DECtalk application user accesses the application through the Motif windows
environment or at the Digital UNIX command line. DECtalk Software also provides
a CDE integration subset that can be installed on systems that support CDE.
DECtalk Software provides several methods of control.  The user can use the
abbreviated command set provided with the application to control basic
operations, such as, the speaking rate or the speaking voice.  The user can
also use the user dictionary to fine-tune the application's basic pronunciation
and voice characteristics.  Finally, the user can also embed in-line commands
into text files to control DECtalk operations.   Refer to the specific sections
for more information on which method to use.<p>

How DECtalk Software Works</a></a>   
</a></h2>
DECtalk Software converts ASCII English language text into speech output
through a speech synthesizer. There are two ways to feed text into the speech
synthesizer: through the user interface or through the API. The flow of the
text-to-speech process is explained below.

<h4>Legend for Figure: Action of the DECtalk Software Module </h4>                                 
<ol><li>A sentence parser breaks the input stream into separate words and locates     
some clause boundaries (indicated by commas and other punctuation marks as       
well as by special words loaded in the DECtalk Software internal dictionary).    
The sentence parser also recognizes and deals with phonemic symbols and          
commands that you might have added to the input text. <p>                           
<li>A word parser breaks words into their component parts, dividing words by      
their final pronounceable form. Strings of text that do not form pronounceable   
English words are spelled out letter by letter. A number formatter is used if    
the text contains numerals. The number formatter applies the rules for many      
common number formats and converts the numbers into English words. The number    
formatter also recognizes many common abbreviations, such as lb for pound.       
<p>                           <li>A dictionary lookup routine searches the pronunciation dictionaries.          
DECtalk Software has a built-in dictionary of many commonly used words.          
DECtalk Software also has a user dictionary that can be filled with words        
specific to an application. This dictionary and how to load it are described     
in Chapter 3. While this version of DECtalk Software has greater pronunciation   
accuracy than its predecessors, it may sometimes be necessary to send DECtalk    
Software the correct phonemics for words important for a particular              
application. This can be done by using the user dictionary.                      
<p>                           <li>A phrase structure module recombines all phonemic output from the             
dictionary search and other modules. Durations of phonemes and pitch commands    
are computed for the clause, and appropriate sound variants are selected for     
those phonemes that can be pronounced in more than one way.                      
<p><li>A letter-to-sound module uses a set of English pronunciation rules to         
assign phonemic form and lexical stress patterns to words not found in the       
dictionary.                                                                      
<p><li>The phoneme-to-voice module processes clauses passed from the phrase          
structure module and converts them to control signals for the speech             
synthesizer. This module modifies the clauses by changing the                    
phonemes/allophones into parameters that determine the natural resonant          
frequencies of the vocal tract (formats), and sound source amplitudes. The       
control parameters are sent to the speech synthesizer for output.                
<p>                           <li>The Digital speech synthesizer computes a speech wave form with acoustic      
characteristics that are determined by the synthesizer control commands          
received.
