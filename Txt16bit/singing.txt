          Singing.

          Singing uses different voice control techniques than
          conversation.  Even untrained singers add liveliness to the sung
          notes by varying pitch slightly, a quality called vibrato.
          Singing in DECtalk would sound mechanical without vibrato.
           Each word or syllable is defined phonemically. The first number
          following a phoneme is the duration in milliseconds, and the
          second number is the pitch in Hertz. Vowels and consonants not
          assigned a pitch remain at the same pitch as preceding segments.
          You can intersperse silence phonemes if you wish.

           DECtalk stays exactly on pitch when the pitch is specified in
          Hertz (Hz). You can add vibrato (to give a more realistic
          singing  quality) by specifying notes with pitch values from 1
          to 37. Note  1 is C2 and 37 is C5 on an equal tempered scale (A4
          = 440 Hz) as  shown below.  C2 is the second C below middle C on
          a piano,  C4 is middle C, and so on.
          An added feature of DECtalk PC is the ability to specify notes
          by their coded value equivalent (below). The coded value is
          simpler to write and is the exact equivalent of the pitch in
          Hertz.

           When notes are specified, DECtalk PC reaches the desired pitch
          within  about 100 ms after the start of the phoneme and adds
          vibrato after  changing to this pitch. When you give a specific
          non-sung pitch,  DECtalk PC reaches the pitch target at the very
          end of the phoneme  with no vibrato. The following example makes
          DECtalk PC "sing" the  first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth
          Symphony.


                   [d<100,17>aa<400> d<100,17>aa<400>].
                   [d<100,17>aa<400> d<120,13>aa<700>].


          The following table contains the pitch values which can be used
          to allow your DECtalk PC to sing. You may use either the number
          in Hz or the coded value.
