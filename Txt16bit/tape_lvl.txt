This is a test of the DECtalk PC.

It will be used to adjust the level of the tape diskette
recorder.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Make the text file. 
2. Listen to it by sending it to the DECtalk. 
3. Edit the text. 
4. When it is edited to satisfaction
and there is no more time, then it is recorded.

Recording consists of connecting the DECtalk PC speaker headphone jack
to the AUX input of the stereo amplifier. The stereo input selector 
is set to AUX and the Tape Monitor is ON. 

A tape is placed in the tape deck and 5-10 seconds of tape are advanced
in the RECORD mode, then PAUSE is engaged.

The levels are adjusted with the test text file. Also, the tape type must 
be selected and Dolby B noise reduction turned ON.

Then the recording is made by playing the text file using the following 
command string:

        COPY filename.txt COM4  (and press ENTER).
