	Installing the Windows Driver and DEMO Program for DECtalk PC.

 The following files come in the DLL001.ZIP file from the BBS:

	DTPC.DLL	DECtalk Driver for Windows,
	WSR.EXE		DEMO Program,
	DLL_USYM.H	MicroSoft C compatible Library,
			(Replaced USER_DLL.H Previously Supplied),
	DECTALK.INI	The init file,
	DTPCW.LIB	Import Library file,
			(Replaced DTPC.LIB Previously Supplied),
	DLL.WRI		Developer's README file in WRITE format,
	DLL.TXT		Developer's README file in TEXT format.

 In order to run the Windows version of the DECtalk PC DEMO program, you must
do the following:


1. Copy the DTPC.DLL file to your DECTALK Directory.

2. Copy the WSR.EXE file to your DECTALK Directory.

3. Copy the DECTALK.INI file to your WINDOWS Directory. 
Important note, if your DECTALK Directory has any other name
other than DECTALK, then you must edit the DECTALK.INI file
and change the second line. That line now reads C:\DECTALK\.
This line must contain the name you are using for your DECTALK
Directory.

4. You need to create a PROGRAM ITEM. To do this you must
open the group that you want to add an item to. From the 
PROGRAM MANAGER FILE MENU, choose NEW. The NEW PROGRAM OBJECT
dialog box appears. Select the PROGRAM ITEM OPTION, and then 
choose OK. The PROGRAM ITEM PROPERTIES dialog box appears.

 TIP:	 When creating a program item, you can quickly open the 
Program Item Properties dialog box by pressing and holding
down ALT while double clicking in a blank area of the group.

 In the Description box, type a description that uniquely
identifies the application, like DECtalk PC. This becomes the 
label that appears under the ICON in the group window. If 
you leave this box blank, Program Manager labels the ICON 
for you.

 In the COMMAND LINE BOX, type the name of the program file,
including the path and extension, C:\DECTALK\WSR.EXE.

 Choose the change Icon button to see the default icon for 
this program item. Scroll through other available icons by 
clicking the scroll arrows or by using the LEFT arrow RIGHT
arrow keys. To change the icon, select the icon you want to
use and choose it.

 Choose OK. The dialog box and the new program item appears in
the group.

	       RUNNING DECTALK PC DEMO Program IN WINDOWS.

NOTE: Because this is a field test version of DECtalk PC for
Windows there are some known problems. But we felt that it was
good enough to show to developers in order for them to get a
feeling for how it works, and also to get input to what you
would like to see in a Windows version of DECtalk PC.

	In order to run the Windows version of DECtalk PC 
you must do the following:

1. Double click on the DECtalk PC Icon . This will bring up the
DECtalk WINDOWS SCREEN READER window.

2. From the MODULE MENU select LOAD. This will start the 
command to load the DECtalk Module.

3. From this point the Windows version of DECtalk PC should
be working and it should say, "Welcome to DECtalk for Windows".

4. At this point you can select setup from the MODULE MENU 
and change any of the DECtalk PC Configurations. After making
any changes select OK.

5. Select READ from the OUTPUT MENU. This will bring up the 
OPEN BOX. From the OPEN BOX you can select any TXT file. Once
you have selected a TXT file click OK.

6. This will bring up the SELECT OUTPUT STYLE BOX. Once you
have selected a style click OK and the DECtalk PC will start
speaking the TXT file.
