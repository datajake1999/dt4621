                            CHAPTER 4
                          TEXT PROCESSING.
                                
         This  chapter  describes how DECtalk processes  numbers,
abbreviations, and acronyms, and how it decides whether a word is
pronounceable. It also includes suggestions for correcting spoken-
output.

TEXT PROCESSING RULES.
DECtalk  processes  text to be spoken by applying  the  following
rules in this order:
        1. The input text stream is broken into groups of letters
delimited  by whitespace characters (spaces, tabs,  or   carriage
returns).
         2. If the letter string is not already phonemic text and
is  to  be converted, any understandable numbers are expanded  to
their word equivalents.
         3.  Some  abbreviations are expanded to their  full-word
equivalents.  DECtalk uses a list of numeric  abbreviations   and
rules  for  a  few  special cases. The user-definable  dictionary
cannot override this conversion.
         4.  Each  letter  string  is broken  into  pronounceable
entities.   Punctuation  (including  parentheses  and   quotation
marks),  hyphenated words, and sequences that must be spelled out
are  analyzed.  Some abbreviations and acronyms are   recognized,
plus any entries from the definable dictionary.
         5.  Any  text that DECtalk recognizes as unpronounceable
(for  example,  a sequence of letters containing  no  vowels)  is
spelled  out. DECtalk contains intelligent strategies for  upper-
case initialisms (e.g., ABC, FBI and the like).
A few rules operate on sequences of words. Interspersing phonemic
symbols  or  DECtalk commands will block these rules.  Therefore,
make sure that spoken  text is as contiguous as possible and keep
breaks   in   structure   (from  English  spelling  to   phonemic
transcription) to a minimum.

The following terms are used below:
Character:   Any  of  the  printable ASCII characters,  including
letters, digits, and punctuation.
Digit  string:  A  string  of  digit characters  (0  through  9).
DECtalk decides whether these should be  pronounced as numbers or
independent characters.
Number:  A  string  of characters (containing  digits)  that  are
processed as a group by DECtalk. For example, "123" is pronounced
"one  hundred  and  twenty-three," while  "1(2)3"  is  pronounced
"one,  two  three" with punctuation disabled, ([:punc  none])  or
"one   left-parenthesis  two  right-parenthesis    three."   with
punctuation enabled ([:punc some]).

NUMBER PROCESSING.
     DECtalk recognizes seven general number classes, and a large
number of special cases and subclasses. The general classes are
as  follows:
Part numbers Strings of mixed letters, digits, and the - and /
characters.

Cardinal numbers.    The simple numbers that are used in counting.
Examples include "123," "123,456," "12.345,"  "01234,"  and
"12%."

Ordinal numbers. Simple strings of numbers with "st," "nd,"  "rd,"
or "th" added, for example, "1st" and  "23rd."
Fractions  Examples are "1/2," "2/3," and "44/100%."

Money.    Recognized as the first character  of a string of digits
by the presence of a dollar sign ($) or a pound sign.
Dates    In  the format (23-Sep-1983), and expandable into  their
English equivalent.

Time  of  day.    In the 24-hour format of some operating  systems
(11:04:03.02), spoken  in its English equivalent. The words  "am"
and   "pm" are correctly processed after time  values. (Note that
"am" and "pm" contain no periods.)

PART NUMBERS.
A  part  number is defined as a string of mixed letters,  digits,
and   the - and / characters, containing at least one digit.  The
following are examples of part numbers:
        DTC07-AM
        MS-DOS V3.1
        54-15966-01

DECtalk  first attempts to find the part number in the developer-
definable  and   fixed dictionaries. If it is  unsuccessful,   it
breaks  the   part  number into strings of  letters,  strings  of
digits, and  separators.

A series of alphanumerics separated by / is spelled out.  DECtalk
correctly  speaks part numbers of the format XXX/YYY.

A string of digits within a part number is spoken as follows.
        1. If the digit string begins with 0 or is more than nine
digits  long,  it is spelled out ("VS01" becomes "vee  ess   zero
one").
        2. One or two-digit strings are spoken as normal cardinal
numbers ("PDP-11" becomes "pee dee pee eleven").
         3.  Three-  or four-digit strings that end with  00  are
spoken  as normal cardinal      numbers ("VT100" becomes "vee tee
one  hundred").
         4.  Other three-digit strings are spoken as "digit, pair
of digits" ("VT320" becomes      "vee tee three twenty").
         5.  Other four-digit strings are spoken as "pair, pair."
("DEC 2040" becomes "deck twenty forty.") Note that if the second
pair  begins with 0, it is pronounced "zero" ("IBM 1401"  becomes
"eye bee em fourteen zero one").
An alphabetic string is spoken as follows.
         1.  One-  or  two-character  strings  are  spelled  out.
("VT100" becomes "vee tee one hundred").
         2.  Longer  strings are searched for in  the  developer-
definable and fixed dictionaries. If they are not found, they are
spelled out  ("DEC 2040" becomes "deck twenty forty").

DECtalk  cannot  handle all possible part numbers perfectly. The
following examples of part numbers are inconsistent with DECtalk's 
number and text processing algorithms:

CICS/VS         Not a part number -- no digits.
net10000        "Net"  is  spelled out since  it  isn't  in  the
                 dictionary.
1E-14            DECtalk will interpret this number as scientific
                 notation if [:mode math] is on.

When  processing numbers and number words, DECtalk first  removes
leading  and trailing punctuation. DECtalk translates "(123)"  as
"one hundred and twenty-three."

CARDINAL NUMBERS.
A  cardinal number is a string of digits. If commas are included,
they  must  break  numbers into groups  of  three.  For  example,
"123,456"  is correct, but "1234,56" is not. The latter  will  be
spelled out as "one two three four comma five six."
Cardinal numbers may also include decimal fractions ("12.34") and
scientific  notation  ("12.34E56"). In scientific  notation,  the
exponent must be less than 100.

A  cardinal number preceded by + or - will be spoken as "plus" or
"minus" whether or not [:mode math ...] is on. The notation ñ  is
pronounced as "plus or minus."
If the first digit is 0 ("01234"), the number will be spoken as a
string of digits as would be appropriate when reading postal  zip
codes.

If the number is greater than 999,999,999, it will be spoken as a
string  of digits with pauses between each group of three digits.
If  commas are provided, they will control the pause behavior. If
not,  the  output  will pause after each group of  three  digits,
provided six or more digits remain. Therefore, "12345678901" will
be spoken as "123, 456, 78901" rather than "12,345,678,901."
Four-digit  numbers without commas are spoken  in  a  variety  of
formats.  For  example,  "5000" becomes  "five  thousand,"  while
"1984"  becomes  "nineteen eighty-four." This  yields  reasonable
behavior when processing years.

Sometimes  DECtalk does not understand the text  well  enough  to
pronounce the number correctly. Here are some examples.

         The telephone number "(617) 493-8255" will be spoken  as
"six  hundred  and seventeen, four ninety three dash  eight   two
five  five."  You can correct this by using one of the  following
steps.
         1.  Spell  out the digits as "six one seven,  four  nine
three, eight two five    five" (notice the commas to make DECtalk
pause at appropriate places).

         2. Separate the digits with spaces and commas: "6 1 7, 4
9 3, 8 2 5 5."

The   software  cannot  easily  distinguish  between  "dash"  and
"minus."

	How much is 10-15?
	Bake this 10-15 minutes.

The [:mode math ] option determines whether the "-" is pronounced
as  "dash"  or "minus." Neither will be pronounced if punctuation
is disabled ([:punc none]).

Some  number  formats are difficult to recognize out of  context.
For   example, the International Standard Date format  (83.09.20)
and the  United States telephone number format (noted previously)
are  sometimes  used  by manufacturers for  part  numbers.  These
ambiguous formats are not recognized by DECtalk and you must make
such manual adjustments if you wish them to be pronounced in some
special way.

After  a  cardinal number, DECtalk recognizes a set  of  standard
numeric   abbreviations  that  are  expanded  to  their   English
equivalent. These abbreviations are coded into DECtalk and cannot
be  modified  by  the applications programmer. DECtalk  correctly
generates  singular and plural forms of these abbreviations.  For
example, 1 mm. is pronounced as "one millimeter" whereas 2 mm. is
pronounced as "two millimeters".

The  numeric abbreviations recognized by DECtalk after a cardinal
number  are listed below. You can write them in either  uppercase
or lowercase letters, but you must follow them by a period.
Other  abbreviations, such as "cc.," are spelled out by  DECtalk.
The  period  that follows such an abbreviation is not  pronounced
("cc."  becomes "see see") but terminates the clause,  while  the
period in number abbreviations does not terminate the clause.

     ORDINAL NUMBERS.
Ordinal  numbers  are formed from a string of  digits  (that  may
contain  appropriate  commas) followed by "st,"  "nd,"  "rd,"  or
"th."   Ordinal  numbers  are  also  generated  by  DECtalk  when
fractions and  dates (in standard Digital format) are processed.
DECtalk  requires that the word portion of the ordinal number  be
correct.  For  example,  "1st" will be processed  correctly,  but
"2th"  will be pronounced "t'uw t'iy 'eych."

     FRACTIONS.
Fractions  consist of one or two digits in the numerator,  the  /
character,  and  one  to  three digits in  the  denominator.  The
numerator may range from 1 to 99, while the denominator may range
from  1  to  100. DECtalk correctly generates singular (1/3)  and
plural (2/3) forms.

     MONEY.
DECtalk assumes a digit string is money when it is introduced  by
the currency symbols $ or .
When the $ or  is recognized, DECtalk allows two forms of number
strings.

         General  digit strings have optional decimal  fractions.
$12.345. is pronounced "Twelve point three four five dollars ."

         Digit  strings are in dollars and cents  (or  pound  and
pence)  format. $12.34  is pronounced "Twelve dollars and  thirty
four cents."

DECtalk recognizes a number of quantity words (hundred, thousand,
million) that modify number processing if they immediately follow
the  money word. For example, "$1.23 million" is pronounced  "one
point two three million dollars."

     DATES.
DECtalk  recognizes  dates  written in  Digital's  standard  date
format, such as "23-Sep-1983," "23-Sep," or "23-Sep-83." However,
it  will  pronounce  "Sep. 23, 1983" as "September  twenty-three,
nineteen eighty-three."

     TIME OF DAY.
DECtalk  recognizes the time of day when written  in  the  format
used   by  Digital  operating systems. Because  this  format  can
easily be confused with part number formats, DECtalk does not try
to  convert the digit string. Instead, it speaks the string  with
appropriate punctuation. Therefore, "12:00" becomes "twelve, zero
zero", rather than "twelve noon".

DECtalk correctly processes time values, including the fractional
second value when it is present.

ABBREVIATIONS.
DECtalk   recognizes,  expands,  and  selects  from  a   set   of
abbreviations taking into the account that the abbreviations  may
be ambiguous.

     ABBREVIATIONS PROCESSED BY DECTALK.
In  addition to the abbreviations that are recognized only  after
cardinal numbers, DECtalk recognizes two special cases, "Dr." and
"St." The pronunciation of these abbreviations depends on whether
the next word is capitalized.

         If  the next word is not capitalized or if there  is  no
next  word  (the  clause  has ended), then  "Dr."  is  pronounced
"drayv" and "St." is pronounced "striyt". The  next word must  be
on the same input line for the rule to work correctly.

        If the next word is capitalized, then "Dr." is pronounced
"d'aaktrr" and "St." is pronounced "seynt".
Following these rules, DECtalk correctly pronounces "Doctor Dobbs
Drive" and "Saint Louis Street" in running text.

        Abbreviations in the Built-In Dictionary.
         The  following  are  some  of the  common  abbreviations
recognized  by  DECtalk  (in alphabetical order);  In  dictionary
lookups,  upper case entries match uppercase only  but  lowercase
entries match either upper or lower case.

Adm.  Apr. Assoc. Aug. Av. Ave. Blvd. Bros. Ch. Cntr. Co.  Comdr.
Corp. Ctr. Dec. Dept. Dist. Feb. Flt. Fr. Fri. Ft. Gen. Gov. Inc.
Intl.  Jan. Jr. Jul. Jun. Ltd. Mar. Mfg. Mon. Mt. Nov.  Oct.  Pl.
Pres. Prof. Rd. Rep. Rev. Rte. Sat. Sen. Sep. Sept. Sr. Sun. Thu.
Thurs.  Tue.  Tues. Univ. Vol. Wed. asst. atty.  bldg.  cm.  cms.
cont.  cu.  deg. doz. e.g. esp. est. etc. ext. fig. fn.  ft.  gm.
hrs.  i.e. kg. kgs. km. lb. lbs. mg. mgs. misc. ml. mm. mr.  mrs.
ms.  msde.  msec. msecs. mss. nt.wt. op.cit. oz. ozs. p.p.d.  pp.
ppd. recd. secy. sq. tbsp. tbsps. tsp. tsps. vs. yds.

If  the  abbreviation can be recognized by DECtalk during  number
processing,  then  the English text form of the  abbreviation  is
spoken.  Otherwise,  the  built-in  dictionary  form  is  spoken.

Dictionaries (developer-definable and fixed) are searched in  the
order in which they are loaded.  The numeric abbreviations can be
blocked by  including a dummy phonemic string, for example, "1  [
]ft. 3."

Dictionary  entries  that contain only uppercase  letters,  match
text  words that contain uppercase letters in the same positions.
However,  the  entries that contain only lowercase  letters,  may
match  text  words  that  contain either lowercase  or  uppercase
letters in the same positions.

"Apr."  matches  "APR."  but  not "apr."  This  is  necessary  to
distinguish  between  words at the end of a  sentence  and  valid
abbreviations, such as "mar" (to damage) and "Mar." (for March).
If a word in the above list is written with a terminating period,
you   must  include that period in the input text. Otherwise,  it
will not terminate  the current clause. For example, It weighed 3
kgs. will not terminate the clause, but  It weighed 3 kgs.. (note
the second period) will terminate the clause.

WORD SPELLOUT STRATEGIES.
After number processing, DECtalk must decide whether to pronounce
a string of characters as a single word or a compound word, or if
it  must  be  spelled out. DECtalk uses the fixed and  developer-
definable  dictionaries and a series of word  transformations  to
make this  decision.

WORD SPELLOUT TESTS.
Number  conversion, number abbreviations, and the  "Street/Saint"
test  have all been performed before DECtalk begins the  decision
tests. Punctuation has not yet been removed.

        1. DECtalk looks for the word in the dictionaries. Again,
dictionaries are searched in the order in which they were loaded.
If the  word is found in any one of the dictionaries,  the search
stops.)

      The   dictionary   lookup  procedure   involves
decomposing words into simpler forms by stripping affixes such as
-ed  and  -ing. If the word is found in  the dictionary,  DECtalk
speaks the associated phonemic  transcription.
      
       2.  If the word is not found, any punctuation around the word
is  removed. If present, the punctuation symbols " ( (( <<   <  [
are  removed  from  the front of the word, and  the   punctuation
symbols " ) )) >> > ] are removed from the end  of the word.  The
square  brackets  [  ]  are  already  discarded  if  the  command
[:phoneme arpabet speak on] has been given

        3. If some punctuation was removed, DECtalk performs a
special test for abbreviations "(e.g., Gen., Gov.,)" and embedded
sentence punctuation ("I went (last year?) to school").

        4. Next, DECtalk looks for initialisms. (An initialism is a
word  written as a string of uppercase letters that may  or   may
not  be  separated  by  ".") For example, the  string   "APO"  is
pronounced  as  "ey pee oh." Other strings with embedded  periods
may be spelled out.  If an initialism is recognized, the last "."
will  terminate the clause, unless it is followed by  some  other
punctuation.

          DECtalk  also  looks  for  relatively  short  sequences
(typically  3-4  letters)  of  all uppercase  characters  without
periods  and treats these as initialisms. If these are determined
(by  a  special  set  of internal rules) to be  non-pronounceable
(e.g.,  ABC, FBI, IBM, etc.) then DECtalk will spell the  string.
This is a new feature of DECtalk.

        5. At this point, all diacritical marks are removed.

        6. If the word is still not found, it is examined for
hyphenation   (as   in  compound  nouns)  and  the   single-quote
character.  A test is also performed to make sure  any  word   or
word  fragment  has enough consonants and vowels.  If  the   test
fails, the word is spelled out.

        This test makes sure that the word does not contain
embedded  punctuation. A word like "sys$system" is  spelled   out
except when the command [:punc none] is given.

        7. If DECtalk decides the word is pronounceable, it
processes  each  part of a compound noun independently.  If the
word is not in the dictionary, it is processed by the  letter-to-
sound rules.

        8. If the word was pronounced, DECtalk examines the
punctuation  after  the word for silence or clause   terminators.
The punctuation marks " ) ] )) produce a  brief silence (only one
silence  is produced, even if  several characters are processed).
The punctuation marks  ; : ! , . ? terminate a clause.

         9. If DECtalk decides that the word must be spelled out, the
entire word is spelled, including left and right  punctuation. If
the  last  letter  of  the word is a clause   terminator,  it  is
considered punctuation and is not  spelled.

         10.  A  single letter, digit, or other character  within
quotes
or   parentheses  is  spelled  out  (but  the  punctuation  isn't
spoken).  "aA""  is pronounced "[aey]" rather  than  "uh."   This
helps DECtalk process lists such as the following.
                (a) books
                (b) newspapers

        11. Brackets, parentheses, and braces act as commas,
producing    a    clause   boundary.   Therefore,   parenthetical
expressions (such as this one) sound more natural.

         12.  When  text is spelled out, a brief pause  is  added
after  each  character. This makes it easier to transcribe  text,
such as part numbers.


Homographs.
Homographs  are  pairs of words whch are spelled  alike  but  are
pronounced  differently (from homo 'same' and  graph  'writing').
For  example, refuse as a verb can mean 'to decline' or  'reject'
and  as a noun can mean 'garbage.'  DECtalk V4.1 will do many  of
these  alternate  forms  automatically.   For  example  it   will
automatically disambiguate and correctly pronounce the  words  in
the  following sentences:

        They refused the produce.
        They produced the refuse.

As  you can see, it takes some intelligence to choose the correct
pronunciation  automatically, although DECtalk  does  very  well.
Occasionally,  however,  it is difficult  if  not  impossible  to
predict  the  correct  pronunciation  as  in  the  case  of  read
(pronouned  as  in  reed or red) since they  can  both  occur  in
identical  syntactic  contexts.  DECtalk  recognizes  a   primary
pronunciation   and  a  secondary  pronunciation.   The   primary
pronunciation  is  the  more  frequent  pronunciation.  If    the
DECtalk's   pronunciation  is  incorrect,  you  can  obtain   the
alternate  pronunciation in a number of ways: (a)  by  placing  a
slash  at  the  beginning of the word  to obtain   the  alternate
pronunciation;  (b)  by  using  the  [:pronounce   primary]   and
[:pronouce  alternate] commands (Chapter 3); (c) by phoneticizing
the word; (d) by inserting a clever misspelling.

        They'll read good books but they /read nothing yesterday.
        They'll read good books but they [:pron alt] read nothing
yesterday.
         They'll  read  good  books  but  they  [r'ehd]   nothing
yesterday.
        They'll read good books but they red nothing yesterday.


Note:  Placing a slash at the beginning of a homograph to  obtain
the  alternate pronunciation will work only if the  [:punc  some]
command is enabled.

Appendix   C   lists the pairs of common homographs that  DECtalk
knows.
