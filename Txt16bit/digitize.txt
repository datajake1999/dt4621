		Using Digitized Sound Files with DECtalk PC.


PLAYING .VOC FILES FROM THE DOS PROMPT.

 In order to use the digitized commmand you must type DTVOC. This command
has switch settings, which are: -D, -T and -S. The switch setting work as
follows:

	-D  forces unit to digitized mode at start. This tells the DECtalk
that it going to be playing a digitized file.

	-T  resets unit to text mode at end. This switch must be used at the
end of a digitized playing in order for the DECtalk to be able to play text
files again.

	-S  Plays Sound Blaster voice file. This switch lets the DECtalk
know the it's going to be playing a Sound Blaster VOC file. The recorded file
MUST have been recorded at 10KHz or it will not play correctly. 

	EXAMPLE:

	 The format for using the DT_VOC command to play a sound file named
	MUSIC.VOC recorded with is Sound Blaster at 10kHz will look like this:

 	DT_VOC (file name.voc) (switches)

	DTVOC MUSIC.VOC -D -S -T

The TSR command DIGITIZED_MODE will put the DECtalk in the digitized
speech mode so that VOC files sent to it will be processed as digitized
sound files.

The command TEXT_MODE will put the DECtalk back into text mode.
