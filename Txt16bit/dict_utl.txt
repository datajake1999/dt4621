                                APPENDIX D
                        APPLICATION DICTIONARY.
          
          
          DECtalk PC has memory allocated for a loadable dictionary. This 
          dictionary is useful in cases where (a) DECtalk makes an error in
          pronounciation, or (b) the pronunciation of a string is unique
          to the application.  For example, if the sequence n/cl should be
          pronounced as not cleared, then a user dictionary entry is
          obviously needed.
                  
                  To create and load a dictionary to DECtalk PC, you must 
          do the following:

          1. Create a dictionary file using an editor with a .tab extention,
          i.e. personal.tab.  The dictionary must be in the following format:
                  
                  (a) an entry must start at the first character of the
          line. Any space or illegal character as the first character of the 
          line causes the line to be treated as a comment and it will 
          therefore not be processed.

                  (b) the syntax is: 
                  
                        grapheme string     phoneme string
           
          A line may be up to 256 characters long.

                  (c) A grapheme  (letter) string is comprised of legal
          graphemes. Legal graphemes are:
          
          A-Z, a-z,  0-9 and select punctuation marks
          (", !, @, &, (, ), -, \,  and /). 
          
          NOTE: The punctuation mark characters may not be used
          at the beginning of the grapheme string. 
          
          The grapheme string may be in either upper or lower case.  
          Uppercase letters match only upper case; lowercase letters 
          match either uppercase or lowercase.
                  
                  (d) the phoneme string is comprised of legal phonemes.
          Phonemes are always in square brackets but may be in either upper 
          or lower case.

          For example,  to make the word "coffee" be pronounced "tea", you
          would enter the following:
          
                        coffee  [t'iy]

          After creating your dictionary file, you can compile and load
          the dictionary by doing the following:
          
          2. Compile the dictionary by typing a command in the following 
          format:

                  user_dic   input dictionary table 

		 Example:  user_dic   personal.tab 
          
	  User_dic is a .BAT file which calls the executable alphabet.exe, 
	  which alphabetized the personal dictionary, then it calls 
	  userdic.exe, which actually compiles the personal dictionary.

          Input files have the default extension of .tab but can be
          anything. Output dictionary files have the extension of .dtu and
          must  have that extension for the loader, DT_LOAD, to find the file
          correctly. If no output file is specified, a file with the same
          name and .dtu extension will be created for the output.

          For example: if your dictionary table is called personal.tab,
          type:
                  user_dic personal.tab

          3. Load the user dictionary by typing:
                  
                  dt_load  personal.dtu


          Your customized dictionary is now loaded.
          
          Note: User dictionary lookups will perform suffix stipping, 
	  therefore, inflected and derived forms of a word do not have
	  to be entered separately.

          Note: The User dictionary can not be loaded onto the board
	  more than once without first restarting either the DECtalk PC
	  or rebooting the machine.

	  Warning: If your PC is powered down, you must reload the
          user dictionary at power-up. To have a user dictionary loaded 
          each time the PC is powered up, the compiled file name 
          should be added to the DT_LOAD command string in AUTOEXEC.BAT.
