DECtalk PC2 (DTC07-BA) Plug and Play Configuration File.

The Install disk for the DECtalk PC2 includes a configuration file named
!dtc07ba.cfg which can be used with the ISA Configuration Utility (I C U) 
that is now shipping with many new PCs.

The procedure for adding the DECtalk PC2 card to the configuration is 
as follows:

1. Run the I C U, 

2. Select the option to add a new card to the "Other" category.

3. Select "Unlisted Card" from the bottom of the list.

4. When prompted,  Do you want to load a configuration (.cfg) file? 
   Select "Yes".

5. At the Load Configuration File dialog box, select the drive in 
   which you have the DECtalk Install diskette.

6. Click on the file name !dtc07ba.cfg which appears in the drop box
   and select the "Open" button.

7. If you have installed the card with the factory settings (e.g.
   Switch  4 and 2 ON and all the others OFF), and the I C U detects no 
   conflicts with other devices in the PC, you can select "OK" and go 
   on to step 8. If not, go to step 7a.

7A. If a conflict exists with other devices you will be presented with
    an optional I/O Address selection, if one is available.

7B. Select the alternative I/O Address presented. 

Note: You will need to reset the switches on the DECtalk PC2 board to match 
      the I/O Address selected after you complete these steps. Refer to
      Table 2 in Section Three of the User Guide for the switch settings. 

8. The DECtalk PC2 should now appear in the "Cards Configured In System:"
   list. 

9. Click on "Yes" to save the configuration.

10. You will be notified that the I C U system configuration has been updated
    and that you should power down the system and ensure that the cards 
    installed in the system match the I C U System Configuration.

11. Click on "OK".  

End of file.
