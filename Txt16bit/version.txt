How to detect the DECtalk PC version number:

In the TSR, DT_DRIV.EXE, we have a GET_STATUS case:
	
	case GET_STATUS	:
	 DFW.dx = DTC.module_status;
	 DFB.cl = num_modules;
	 DFW.ax = TSR_SUCCESS;
	 DFB.ch = 422;	/* version number */
	break;


Example from DTDEMO.C to retrieve the version number from GET_STATUS

	case 'z':       /* to get the DECtalk version number*/
            if (status() == TSR_SUCCESS)
            break;         


	status()  
		{       
		RB.ah = DECTALK_ID;
		RB.al = GET_STATUS;
		RW.si = 0;
	 	_int86(0x2f, &regs, &regs);
		stat=RB.ch;
   		printf("The DECtalk version number is %d.\n",stat);
		return(RW.ax);
		} 

Version 4.2A:

What is printed is "the DECtalk version number is 165."
To get the correct version, add 256 to 165.  That equals 421, which is 
4.21 essentially 4.2A.

Version 4.2B:

What is printed is "the DECtalk version number is 166."
To get the correct version, add 256 to 166.  That equals 422, which is 
4.22 essentially 4.2B.
