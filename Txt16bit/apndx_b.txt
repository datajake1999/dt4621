                  DECTALK PHONEMIC SYMBOLS.
                              
Several  English phonemic alphabets are widely used  today.
The  Table below  lists the phonemic alphabets that DECtalk
uses,   along   with  an  example  of  each   sound.   Some
dictionaries put the stress symbol after the vowel  nucleus
or   at  the start of the syllable.  DECtalk requires  that
the stress  symbol appear immediately  before the vowel.

Note:  For  defining pitch within typing  tables,  use  the
command  [:pitch  nn]. This changes the  default  pitch  in
typing  mode  from  +35 to +nn where  nn  is  some  decimal
number.

Musical Notes
DECtalk  can  also be used to sing songs  or  make  various
sounds associated with singing and tones. The following  is
a  table that allows the developer to more easily encode  a
phonemic sequence to produce such sounds.

Note:  In  DECtalk  DTC01, the pitch was  calibrated  to  a
physical  scale.  The new pitches are now calibrated  to  a
musical  scale.  This will put them on the  same  scale  as
musical  instruments (i.e., middle A = 440 Hz  rather  than
430.4 Hz).

The  Number  is  the code used for Pitch, in  the  phonemic
command [<duration,pitch>].
