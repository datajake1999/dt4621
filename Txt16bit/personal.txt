                        DECtalk PC Personal Dictionary.
 
 We have created and complied a personal dictionary that has the following
 words in it. The name of the file is PERSONAL.DTU. Each word in this 
 Personal dictionary has been requested by a DECtalk PC user. From time to 
 time this Personal dictionary will be updated and the new words will be 
 posted in it. If you have any requests please let me know by leaving a 
 message on our BBS (508) 467-3806. When 
 you use this Personal dictionary, it will precede the DECtalk dictionary. 
 So if you do not want to have DECtalk say these words the way the Personal 
 dictionary says them, you can edit the file PERSONAL.TAB and remove any of 
 the unwanted words. Then run the .BAT file USER_DIC.BAT to recomplie the 
 file. In order to do this, you must type USER_DIC PERSONAL.TAB. 
 
 In order for DECtalk to use this file you must load your new PERSONAL.DTU 
 file, by editing your and DT.BAT files and add PERSONAL.DTU to the end of 
 the DT_LOAD line.  Then reload the DECtalk PC by typing DT.BAT from your
 DECtalk directory.
 
 A PERSONAL.TAB file looks like this:
