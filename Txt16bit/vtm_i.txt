	Note: The supplied file PHVDEF.H MUST must be compiled with the 
	symbol 'i386' defined if it is used with the integer VTM.

		This code was not intended to be compiled and run as is. 
	It is a reference source for the vocal tract code. The 
	implementation details, exact definition of multiples, and I/O 
	vary too much from system to system. For example some DSP's
	perform 16 bit integer multiples, while others do fractional 
	arithmetic. Also if your using a DSP for the vocal tract as 
	opposed to a general purpose processor or a risc chip the
	implementation of the filters is typically very specific to that
	particular chip and must be done in assembler. TThe c compiler
	would generate very inefficient code.
