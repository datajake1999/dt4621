Due to the growing e-mail market, users want to have access to their e-mail via
telephone. It is an important, however informal, mode of business communication. 
It includes various abbreviations, acronyms, playful graphics and un-punctuated 
sentences, which made e-mail reading almost impossible for most synthesizers.

The DECtalk technology has now incorporated new, specialized rules to better speak 
e-mail messages. This is accomplished by eliminating un-needed control information.
and interpreting the typical short cuts used in e-mail messaging.
 
In the example below, notice the e-mail header will be stripped to only speak the 
date, subject and sender, while the footer will be completely removed.  Also note 
that the abbreviations are expanded to their true form, E S T will be read as 
Eastern Standard Time and St. James St. will be voiced as Saint James Street.
