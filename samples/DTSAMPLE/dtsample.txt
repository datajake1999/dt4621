          DECtalk SAMPLE PROGRAM


          Program "dtsample.c" demonstrates most of the DECtalk API calls.

     This program includes the API definition file "ttsapi.h" and is linked

     with "dectalk.lib". If the Software Development Kit (SDK) is installed

     on your computer, then bring up a DOS box, set it to the sample directory,

     and type "nmake". This will produce executable file "dtsample.exe".

     This may be executed at the DOS prompt or clicked on from the FIle

     Manager.

          Any windows application may call any of the DECtalk API functions

     by including file "ttsapi.h" and linking with "dectalk.lib" as long as

     as the Dynamic Link Library file "dectalk.dll" is installed. The

     functions which are used should be listed in the module definition

     file. This file is used by the linker to allow "dectalk.lib" to

     access the functions in the Dynamic Link Library (DLL) dectalk.dll.
