VerCheck v1.0  FORCE computer Inc.
--------------------------------------------
Purpose: VerCheck will detect the version number and version string from a DECtalk DLL file.

Theory of Operation: Beginning with DECtalk software v4.4a, the DLL contains a function
called TextToSpeechVersion which can return the DLL version information. This function can
be used without going through any of the DLL locking mechanisms used for licensing. Earlier
versions of the DLL are detected based on the functions available in the DLL.

Step 1: LoadLibrary("DECtalk.DLL")
 On failure, the error code is checked. If the error is due to 16-bit DLL loading into a
 32-bit OS (NT) or from a DEV (Device) error. This will flag the system to fill in the
 information as follows:
  DECtalk version 1.0 (build 10)
  DECtalk PC 16-bit DLL v1.0

 If the error code is from another reason, the version is listed as follows:
  DECtalk version 0.0 (build ???)
  DECtalk DLL not found
 The build number lists the Windows GetLastError number returned from LoadLibrary

Step 2: GetProcAddress(mod,"TextToSpeechVersion")
 The next step is to fetch the address of the TextToSpeechVersion function for calling. If
 the function returns a non-NULL pointer, we will call the function, and use it's return
 data to display the version, otherwise, we continue.

Step 3: GetProcAddress(mod,"TextToSpeechStartup")
 Our last test is to try to fetch the TextToSpeechStartup function. Since this is only
 implimented in the DECtalk software releases that do not contain version information (4.3)
 we can safely assume if the function exists without TextToSpeechVersion that it is 4.3.
 In this case, we issue the following:
  DECtalk version 4.3 (build 100)
  DECtalk 4.3 or earlier

 Otherwise, we assume a 32-bit DECtalk PC interface (Currently, no known versions exist)
  DECtalk version 1.0 (build 10)
  DECtalk PC 32-bit DLL v1.0

After this, we close the DLL, and wait for the user to press OK.
