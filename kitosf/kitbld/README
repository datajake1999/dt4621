Information about DECtalk specific to Linux.

The user that runs a DECtalk application must have write permission
to /dev/dsp. Access to /dev/mixer will allow DECtalk to control the volume

The code for intel hardware has been built on 2 versions of redhat,
5.0 and 6.2.  The 5.0 version may work on newer versions, but the 
6.2 probably will not work on older versions of redhat.

DECtalk is a product licensed by number of concurrent uses.  So,
It creates a file /var/tmp/DECtalk.pids where the current license 
information is stored while DECtalk is running.  If a DECtalk application 
crashes, the file /var/tmp/DECtalk.pids may have to be removed manually,
and only should be removed if no other DECtalk applications are running.
DECtalk tries to free licenses that are used by programs that are
no longer running.

To run the graphical sample programs, you have to have glib 1.2.0.0.7 or later
and gtk 1.2.0.5.2 or later.  Both of these pacakges are available from
http://www.gtk.org/

Currently pause and resume do not work.  This is because the functions
TextToSpeechPause and TextToSpeechResume do not work.

One of the sample programs in the kit is "say"  Rsynth comes with a 
program called "say" and this install may clobber the say from rsynth,
or the say from rsynth will be the one called when the program say is
executed.
