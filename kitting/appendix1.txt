  FILES:
  The following files are contained on the installation SOURCE diskette.  
  Most of these files are copied (or decompressed and copied) to
  the DESTINATION drives.  Note the \DECTALK directory on the 
  destination drive may have a different name if selected by the user.  
  The system directories are generally the "Win95" directory and its 
  sub-directory "System", for Windows 95, or "Windows" directory and its
  sub-directory "System", for Windows 98/Windows Millennium
  "WINNT" directory and its sub-directory "System32", for Windows NT and windows 2000. 
  Examples will use Windows 95.
  For the following:
					xx is the language code (i.e. "us").
					xxx refers to either wce200 or wce300
					x refers to either mspro or palm

  UNIX SDK: 
  For a list of files for Compaq True64 UNIX, see the Installation Guide.
  
  WINDOWS SDK and CE SDK:
  The list of files assume the following directory structure and 
  source/destination structure.

     Windows directory          C:\Windows
     Windows System Directory   C:\Windows\system
     User selected directory    C:\Program Files\DECtalk

  D: is the source directory (CD rom drive) and C: is the destination directory.
