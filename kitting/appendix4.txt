	USING THE NEW DICTIONARY VARIANTS:

DECtalk Software now provides reduced-size pronunciation dictionaries
for U.S. English (small or medium), U.K. English (small), and German
(small).  To use a smaller variant in place of a language's default
dictionary, you must rename the variant to match the name the software
expects:

    dtalk_uss.dic           to      dtalk_us.dic
    dtalk_usm.dic           to      dtalk_us.dic
    dtalk_uks.dic           to      dtalk_uk.dic
    dtalk_grs.dic           to      dtalk_gr.dic.


KNOWN PROBLEMS:

-For Windows:  If DECtalk Software is installed and you use Adobe
 Acrobat Version 4.0C or later, you may get a "Program Error" message,
 due to a conflict with SAPI Version 3.0 support.  The reason for the
 error message has to do with SAPI as incorporated into Acrobat.  This
 bug is being investigated.

 Workaround #1:  Go to the directory C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat
 4.0\Reader.  Make a new subdirectory in "Reader" named "temp".  Next,
 go to C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 4.0\Reader\plug_ins and move the
 file "AcroForm" from the "plug_ins" folder into the the newly created
 "temp" folder.  Make sure the file "AcroForm" is removed from the
 plug_ins folder.  This should allow you to start Acrobat Reader and
 open a document.

 Workaround #2:  If you do not plan to use SAPI with DECtalk, you can
 remove SAPI Version 3.0 support for DECtalk by going to the Speech
 directory for your version of Windows and deleting the files
 dtlkttse_*.dll.  The Speech directory is C:\Windows\Speech for
 Windows 95/98/ME and C:\Winnt\Speech for Windows NT/2000.

-For Windows, SAPI Version 3:  The O L E ITTSCentral::TextData
 function does not accept a NULL value for the NotifyInterface (the
 4th C++ argument).


CAUTIONS:

-For Windows, Static Access32:  The developer MUST include the
 Microsoft library WINMM.LIB in the link process.

-Improper use of the Log in-line command may appear to hang the
 engine.  See the Log command description in the DECtalk Software
 Reference Guide for proper use guidelines.

-Dictionaries of one language can be loaded into engines of another.
 However, if you use this feature, you must carefully manage the
 adding and removing of dictionaries to avoid confusion over
 dictionary naming, identity, and associations.
