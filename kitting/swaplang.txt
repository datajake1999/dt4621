Installation extras:
--------------------

User must note that the last kit installed will become
the default language settings.


To change the languages:
------------------------

User should run SET2US.BAT (SET2SP.BAT, SET2GR.BAT or
SET2LA.BAT) inside the DECtalk directory, where set2us.bat
will set up US English as the language setting (set2sp will
set up SPANISH, set2gr will set up GERMAN, and set2la will
set up LATIN AMERICAN). Each time a file is run, the default
language is changed.


Notes:
------

When UNINSTALLING - you will completely disable DECtalk
no matter what language you uninstall.  Currently, DECtalk
was designed to on run one language on one computer.
In future releases, DECtalk will have the ability to run
all installed languages at once without having to run
the language SETUP back and forth.
Also, NOTE: after UNINSTALLING, install shield might
leave empty directories and the directories of the different
languages previously installed.  You should delete these
directories manually.
(Or run uninstall:
C:\WINDOWS\uninst.exe -fC:\PROGRAM FILE\DECtalk\DeIsL1.isu
and use the *.isu files left inside the DECtalk directory.)


This patch is provided only as way to continue running DECtalk
with different languages.  Note, in order for file swapping
(language setup) to work - the DLL and DICTIONARY files
must not be locked by an application.

NT USERS!!! - NOTE:
-------------------
It seems that this swaping of files will not work as expected
under NT.  It is recommended that all of the DECtalk DLL
(dectalk.dll dtlkttse.dll) and DECtalk dictionary file
(dectalk.dic) be all placed in one directory and then
have the applications run in the same directory.  This will
ensure that the application will pick up the correct language
components during run time.
